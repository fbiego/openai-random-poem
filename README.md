### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a game,  
A puzzle to solve and a challenge to tame.  
  
A complex web of code,  
A language of life, to keep you on the road.  
  
With logic and strategy,  
A program to write, and the world you can light.  
  
A journey of discovery,  
A world of new possibilities, with no boundaries.  
  
From 0 to 1,  
A journey of fun, to see where you run.  
  
Programming is like a dream,  
A world of endless possibilities, and endless streams.
