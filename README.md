### today's poem  
  
Programming, oh programming  
You have a way of making me sing  
It's an ever-evolving art  
That I'm eager to impart  
  
I start with a problem to solve  
My code must be precise and involve  
Variables, functions, and so much more  
Leading me to a digital door  
  
I'll debug and refine my work  
To ensure no glitches will lurk  
My code will be a perfect fit  
And it will all come together bit by bit  
  
I'll end up with something so grand  
A result that I can command  
This joy of programming I find  
Is one of the most rewarding of kinds
