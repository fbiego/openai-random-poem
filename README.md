### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a fine wine,  
It can take you anywhere you want to go,  
Take you to a different time,  
Where you can explore and grow.  
  
It can be the answer for you,  
The answer to your problem,  
It can be a challenge,  
That you can easily solve.  
  
Programming can be like a story,  
A story that you create,  
A story that you write,  
A story that you can master with ease.  
  
It can be the key to success,  
A key that can unlock the door,  
A key that can help you achieve,  
What you want, and so much more.  
  
Programming is like the wind,  
It can blow you in any direction,  
Giving you the chance to explore,  
And to learn something new, with precision.
