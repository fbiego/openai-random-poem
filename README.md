### today's poem  
  
Programming is a way to make things  
A way to solve problems and create dreams  
  
It's a language of sorts, to be sure  
A language of ones and zeroes, written in allure  
  
You can build things in a network of code  
From a website to a video game mode  
  
Programming is a way to express  
Your thoughts and ideas, no matter the stress  
  
It can be tricky and hard to learn  
But the rewards are worth it in the end  
  
Programming is a way to make things  
A way to solve problems and create dreams
