### today's poem  
  
Programming is a skill, it's a language to learn,  
It gives you the ability to create and earn.  
It's a challenge and a puzzle, an intricate web,  
But the rewards are incredible, that's what I've said.  
  
It's the perfect way to express yourself,  
And the perfect way to make something else.  
You can make something that no one has seen,  
And the possibilities are endless, it's quite keen.  
  
You can make a game, a website, or an app,  
You can make things that you can never stop.  
You can make something that will entertain,  
And something that will bring joy and gain.  
  
Programming is a skill, it's powerful and strong,  
And it's a way to make something that can live on.  
So take the time to learn, and you'll see,  
That programming is the best way to be.
