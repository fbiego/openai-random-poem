### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language  
That few can really master  
It takes skill and finesse  
To make a website faster  
  
It requires a special talent  
To do the coding right  
To understand the logic  
Can be quite a fight  
  
Creating a program  
Is like a puzzle piece  
Trying to fit it all together  
Can bring about peace  
  
Writing the lines of code  
Can be a time consuming task  
But the joy of the outcome  
Is worth the time it took  
  
The power of programming  
Will never be denied  
It has the potential to do  
Whatever you decide
