### today's poem  
  
Programming, an art so divine,  
So powerful, yet oh so sublime.  
A powerful tool, to help us succeed,  
To make our lives so much easier indeed.  
  
It's a language so complex,  
A tool that helps us connect.  
To make our dreams so real,  
The power of programming we can feel.  
  
It's a skill that's hard to master,  
But with practice, it won't be a disaster.  
So take some time, learn the basics first,  
Then you can go for more, and be the best.  
  
Programming, a language so powerful and vast,  
It's a skill that will last.  
So use your knowledge, for the world to see,  
Programming is a skill that can help you be free.
