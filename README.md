### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle  
it's a challenging game  
If you can solve it,  
you're not the same  
  
You need to think ahead  
and anticipate the moves  
It's a game of logic and ability  
that you need to prove  
  
You have to write the code  
and make it work  
It's like a jigsaw  
without the perk  
  
It's time consuming but worth it  
in the end  
Programming is a skill  
you can always depend
