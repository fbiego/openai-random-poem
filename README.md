### today's poem  
  
Programming is a skill that none can deny  
It can be tricky to learn, but it's worth a try  
For it's used in so many places, and in so many ways  
It's a challenge that can take a lifetime to master  
  
To learn how to code, you must be patient and bold  
For while the basics are easy to hold  
The deeper you go, the more complex it gets  
But the rewards are worth the effort, no one can forget  
  
Programming can be used for anything from games to finance  
To create something that's truly immense  
It's a language that is understood by machines  
No matter the task, programming is the key  
  
So if you have the drive and the ambition  
To create something that's truly grand  
Then take up programming and set your dreams in motion  
And watch as your ideas come to life, in this digital land.
