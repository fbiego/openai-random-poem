### today's poem  
  
Programming is a wondrous thing,  
It makes the computer to sing.  
It can make a robot run,  
And make a website have some fun.   
  
It can make a game come alive,  
And keep it going day and night.  
It can make a program do,  
Just about anything you want it to.   
  
It can make a program work,  
And make sure it never goes berserk.  
It can make a computer learn,  
And make sure it never ever crashes or gets burned.   
  
Programming is a skill so grand,  
It can make your dreams come true at your command.  
It can make our lives so much better,  
And make us all feel so much better.
