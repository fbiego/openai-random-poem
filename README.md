### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle  
A challenge I can't refuse  
Piecing it together bit by bit  
The code I must produce  
  
I sometimes get stuck and frustrated  
But I can't give up the fight  
So I take a break and try again  
To get it just right  
  
Programming makes me think  
It's a game I can't resist  
I must figure out each step  
To complete the task I've missed  
  
I'm determined to succeed  
No matter how hard it may seem  
Figuring out this code  
Is my favorite coding dream
