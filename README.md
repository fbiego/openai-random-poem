### today's poem  
  
A language of ones and zeros  
Living in a world of logic  
A paradise for those who know  
How to make the computer flow  
  
A journey of discovery  
A mind that's full of glee  
To learn the tools and techniques  
That make applications run free  
  
The syntax and the rules  
The if-then-else for fools  
The loops and functions, oh so neat  
To make a program run complete  
  
A language that's ever-evolving  
A world of creativity  
A language that can bring ideas  
To life with such agility  
  
A place of creativity  
A language of ingenuity  
A world of logic and reason  
That can bring a dream to reality
