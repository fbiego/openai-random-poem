### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle,  
A challenge that I love to tussle.  
Writing code that works just right,  
Makes me feel like a computer knight.  
  
Logic and structure in perfect harmony,  
Bugs and errors that I must vanquish quickly.  
Coding is a creative expression,  
One that I can't help but obsess.  
  
A language of numbers and symbols so grand,  
It's the way to create the future in the palm of my hand.  
I love to be a programmer,  
My skill is something that I can offer.
