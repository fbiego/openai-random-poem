### today's poem  
  
A sequence of commands to direct a machine  
A way to order a computer to do something neat  
A means to calculate, analyze, and scheme  
Programming is the language of our digital dreams  
  
A way to input data and get a result  
A way to create a piece of art that's felt  
A way to write a code and make it run  
Programming is the way to have some fun  
  
A way to solve puzzles and complex equations  
A way to test theories and their implications  
A way to build something with just a few lines  
Programming is the way to make it shine  
  
Programming is a language that is like no other  
It's a way of coding that can be an amazing discovery  
So open that terminal, type in some commands  
A whole new world awaits, let the programming begin!
