### today's poem  
  
Programming, oh such a tedious endeavor  
A journey of logic and thought forever  
  
Lines of code and functions to be written  
Instructions to be followed, never to be smitten  
  
Debugging the code, line-by-line  
Tracing the bug, a tricky design  
  
Bytes of data and algorithms of form  
The result of which, is the goal to perform  
  
Testing the program, to make sure it works  
Checking the syntax, every bit that lurks  
  
Finally, the program is ready to go  
It's time to deploy, the result is a show  
  
Programming, the art of making machines  
The end result, a world of unseen dreams
