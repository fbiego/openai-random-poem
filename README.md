### today's poem  
  
My mind is a fortress,  
My thoughts a wall of code  
My heart is a library,  
My feelings a deep-seeded code.  
  
Logic and reason,  
My thoughts are a mess  
A problem to solve,  
A challenge best.  
  
My fingers keep typing,  
My brain never stops  
My code is my language,  
A skill I'll never drop.  
  
A challenge to conquer,  
A task to achieve  
Programming is a passion,  
The power I'll receive.  
  
My mind is a fortress,  
My thoughts a wall of code  
My heart is a library,  
My feelings a deep-seeded code.
