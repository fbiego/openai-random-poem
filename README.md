### today's poem  
  
Programming, the art of it  
Where machines can learn to do it  
An opportunity to create  
And bring ideas to life  
  
Simple instructions that guide  
From the basic commands to complex ones  
To create powerful programs that can do  
Anything they are tasked to run  
  
It's a mental challenge  
Where you can build up your skills  
And create something that was once  
Just a mere thought that exists  
  
Programming, the art of it  
Where machines can learn to do it  
A chance to explore and discover  
A world of possibilities.
