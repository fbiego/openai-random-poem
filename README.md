### today's poem  
  
Programming, a way to make our dreams reality  
A way to create a world of fantasy  
A way to take our ideas and turn them into a visual feast  
Making an impact beyond all expectations, at least  
  
Programming, a way to bring our visions to life  
A way to construct a world where we can thrive  
A way to bring our thoughts to the digital domain  
Where we can build upon our dreams and create a unique gain  
  
Programming, a way to bring a world of possibilities  
A way to create a world where anything is achievable  
A way to take our imaginations and make them a reality  
Where we can expand our horizons and reach our ultimate goal of victory
