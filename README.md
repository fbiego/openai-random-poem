Programming is a way to explore
A language that we build and adore

Creating apps, websites and games,
Where the limits of our minds remain

Writing code to express our intent
Decisions that define our content

Debugging our mistakes with ease
Our errors are only what we please

Programming is an art of skill
It's the language that we will

A way to solve problems and more
Designing the future, evermore
