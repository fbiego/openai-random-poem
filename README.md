### today's poem  
  
Programming is an artform,  
A way to create without a storm  
It can be a challenge,  
But it's not a game of chance.  
  
It's a way to express yourself,  
A way to make something out of nothing else  
It can be daunting and intimidating,  
But with practice it can be fascinating.  
  
It has its own unique language,  
That can feel like a strange, new age  
Full of loops and syntax,  
But it's worth the time to learn the tricks.  
  
It's a puzzle to be solved,  
A way to make something evolve  
A way to show creativity,  
And watch a solution come to be.
