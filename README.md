### today's poem  
  
Programming is a great way to pass the time  
You can build something new, or something sublime  
The possibilities are endless, the challenges you'll face  
You'll learn a lot and have a lot of fun in the race  
  
You can learn to make websites, or games, or apps  
And add a few features that make them snap  
When you finally finish, the feeling of accomplishment you'll find  
Is a reward that's better than anything you can buy  
  
Programming is a skill, and it's something to be proud of  
Learning and mastering the craft is quite tough  
But the rewards are worth it, and you'll be glad you worked hard  
When you can create something that's truly amazing and a work of art  
  
Programming can be quite complicated and time consuming  
But it's also extremely rewarding and the knowledge you'll be gaining  
It's a skill that will stay with you for a lifetime  
And it's something you can use to make your life shine
