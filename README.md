### today's poem  
  
Programming is a challenge,  
A puzzle to unravel.  
It begins with a question,  
And a path you must travel.  
  
It takes patience and practice,  
And a will to persevere.  
It requires logic and reason,  
To make it come clear.  
  
It's a complex structure,  
Which requires attention.  
A smooth and concise code,  
For a successful invention.  
  
Yet with time and dedication,  
Programming can be done.  
And you'll have created a masterpiece,  
It's a beautiful thing to behold, when it's all said and done.
