### today's poem  
  
Programming is my art,  
A craft I must master.  
The logic and the code,  
A skill that I must foster.  
  
I'll debug and I'll test,  
Each line I must review.  
Make sure that the syntax  
Is perfect and true.  
  
The challenge is great,  
And I must persist.  
I'll keep on coding,  
With skill and a list.  
  
For the coding is fun,  
And I'll never tire.  
My passion will never die,  
As I write code with fire.
