### today's poem  
  
My code is my life, my computer my tool,  
My programs are my pride, my logic my rule.  
  
I can make a website, I can make a game,  
I can make a program, I'm never the same.  
  
My programs come to life, they start to work,  
My code is my passion, my heart will never shirk.  
  
My programs are my art, my code is my song,  
My programs are my joy, I'll never be wrong.  
  
My programs will live, my code will be shared,  
My programs will stand, my code will be spared.  
  
My code will live on, my programs will thrive,  
My programs will remain, as long as I'm alive.
