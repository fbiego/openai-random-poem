### today's poem  
  
A program of ones and zeros  
A language of mystery and code  
A way to create something new  
A program's like a book to unfold  
  
From HTML to Java and C sharp  
Each language a different part of the mix  
We write, we debug, we solve, we debug  
A program's like a puzzle that we fix  
  
A program can be small or large in size  
A program can be complex or simple and brief  
A program can be useful and fun  
A program can make a life more complete  
  
A program can be made to do amazing things  
From a game to a web or a chatbot  
A program can be a work of art  
It's creative and unique, like a painting, we plot  
  
Programming is a craft that takes time  
To master it, you need patience and skill  
But once you understand it, it's worth the climb  
Programming is an art that's worth the thrill
