### today's poem  
  
Programming, what a strange and wondrous thing  
A crafty, technical masterpiece that can make even the best of kings sing  
  
Creating a language of ones and zeros  
Time spent coding, a masterful show  
  
From websites to video games, this craft is a must  
For many a computer, it is a necessary trust  
  
A web of complexity, a far-reaching net  
Programming is something that we should not forget  
  
From the simple to the complex, the language is always the same  
A language of algorithms and logic, to help us on our way  
  
Programming is a puzzle, an ever-changing riddle  
But with perseverance and skill, it's something we can all middle  
  
A skill like no other, it's one of the best  
So let's grab our laptops and give it a test!
