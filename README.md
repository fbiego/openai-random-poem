### today's poem  
  
A coding life is a challenge that's true  
But the reward of a working program too  
  
A challenge of logic and syntax  
Can seem overwhelming but not so complex  
  
It's not a race, there's no real time  
Just solve the problem one line at a time  
  
Step by step, slowly but surely  
The program gradually starts to work properly  
  
It's a journey of trial and error  
But the outcome is worth it, no need to terror  
  
The satisfaction of a successful coding project  
A feeling that's not easily forget
