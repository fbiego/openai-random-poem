### today's poem  
  
Programming, oh so grand  
A language that I understand  
No matter the task at hand  
It's the tools I use to expand  
  
From a simple website to a complex system  
It's the foundation of a new paradigm  
A language that's powerful and sublime  
It's the language of the modern age, this time  
  
A language that can be so precise  
It's like a puzzle that needs to be solved  
A language that's filled with surprise  
That can solve problems that were unsolved  
  
Programming is a skill that's so vital  
It's like a superpower that's so essential  
It can help us change the world  
And make complex things quite simple
