### today's poem  
  
Programming, a complex universe of its own  
A language that lives within my bones  
The power of a few lines, to create something grand  
The challenge of finding the solutions to a problem, so grand  
  
A puzzle of ones and zeroes  
Solving the problems, until I'm in a daze  
Coding, a task in which I'm so engaged  
Creating a masterpiece, despite all of the rage  
  
Debugging, a never-ending cycle  
Testing, to make sure things are in check  
Variables, loops, and classes too  
A coding journey, that I'm so happy to pursue  
  
Programming, the language of dreams  
A world of possibilities that I can explore  
Creating a complex network of codes  
To make something beautiful, that I can adore
