### today's poem  
  
Programming is a code so true  
A language of numbers and symbols too  
It's a language of algorithms and bytes  
A way of building things right  
  
It's a way to create things anew  
To give instructions to computers so true  
A language of if statements and loops  
A way to make programs so smooth  
  
It's a math so precise  
A way to create a device  
To take an idea from a thought  
And turn it into a thing that's sought  
  
Programming is a way to build  
To create something, something to fill  
A need or a desire that's seen  
Using instructions that are so keen  
  
Programming is a way to solve  
To take something from a thought to a whole  
To take an idea from a thought  
And turn it into something sought
