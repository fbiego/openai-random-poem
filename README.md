### today's poem  
  
Programming my life,  
A labor of love and strife,  
My thoughts and ideas,  
Forming into code with ease,  
  
Computer science my new friend,  
My skills I now must mend,  
Debugging and designing,  
Each task is so enthralling,  
  
Coding and learning,  
My creativity is burning,  
Finding a solution,  
My mind is in revolution,  
  
Logic and algorithms,  
My skillsets ever growing,  
A computer's my new tool,  
My future I must keep cool.
