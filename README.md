### today's poem  
  
Programming is a complex art  
Sometimes I feel like I'm falling apart  
I get frustrated and overwhelmed  
But I keep going, so I'm not dispelled  
  
I'm learning new languages every day  
From Python to Java and beyond  
It's not easy, but I'm determined  
To make a program so strong  
  
I'm getting better with every line  
Finding ways to make it shine  
Sometimes I'm stuck and I can't see  
But I keep going, so I'm not defeated  
  
It's a challenge, but I'm learning so much  
I'm now able to do things I couldn't touch  
I'm becoming proficient in this coding craft  
And that's what matters in the end
