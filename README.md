### today's poem  
  
The clock's ticking, the code's wracking,  
A new challenge I'm now attacking.  
I'm writing in bliss, I'm coding with a kiss,  
I'm so in love with programming.  
  
My fingers they type, my syntax is tight,  
My code compiles without a fight.  
My thoughts now so clear, my future looks near,  
I'm so in love with programming.  
  
My journey's begun, I've only just started,  
My learning is only just started.  
My dreams, they are grand, I'm loving the plan,  
I'm so in love with programming.  
  
My enthusiasm's high, my future looks bright,  
My skills, they are sure to ignite.  
My confidence grows, my knowledge flows,  
I'm so in love with programming.  
  
My heart skips a beat, when I'm coding away,  
My mind, it is completely astray.  
My passion shines through, my joy, it is true,  
I'm so in love with programming.
