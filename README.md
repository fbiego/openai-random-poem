### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a game of tetris  
Different pieces come together to make a set  
Colors and shapes come together to form a perfect fit  
The code is written and debugged until it's all set  
  
The goal is to make a program that runs as smooth as silk  
But it takes a lot of time and patience to make it work  
A lot of trial and error and some debugging tricks  
To make sure that the code is free from errors and bugs  
  
It can be frustrating when a program just won't work  
The challenge is to find the problem and fix it with a jerk  
But when the code runs and works as expected  
It's a feeling of accomplishment that can't be reckoned  
  
Programming is a skill that can take you far  
Creating a program from scratch is quite a feat  
The feeling of accomplishment is unlike any other  
Knowing you made something amazing with your own hands and computer.
