### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle  
A complex solution to a problem  
It requires a lot of thought  
To solve it in the proper way  
  
At times the code can be tricky  
But with enough hard work and dedication  
You can find the perfect solution  
For any code you create  
  
Programming can be a challenge  
But it can be a lot of fun  
If you keep trying and don't give up  
You can make something great  
  
Programming is an art  
A skill that takes time and effort  
It can be frustrating at times  
But the rewards are worth it in the end
