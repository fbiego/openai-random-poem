### today's poem  
  
Coding and programming,  
An art thatâ€™s unique and fun,  
A world of endless possibilities,  
Where anything can be done.  
  
Inputting codes and algorithms,  
Lines full of symbols and numbers,  
Bringing life to machines,  
Creating something that slumbers.  
  
Debugging and testing,  
Making sure the code is right,  
Writing loops and conditions,  
And making sure the logic is tight.  
  
Designing a user interface,  
Making sure it looks just right,  
Building applications and websites,  
So people can access day and night.  
  
Programming is a skill,  
That requires patience and time,  
But it can be rewarding,  
In the end, it will all be just fine.
