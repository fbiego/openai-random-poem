### today's poem  
  
Programming so powerful,  
It's like an art,  
It brings ideas to life,  
A computer's true heart.  
  
From basic to complex,  
It's all so divine,  
The power of programming,  
Can make things shine.  
  
Creating a website,  
or making a game,  
The possibilities,  
Are all the same.  
  
No matter the language,  
The logic remains,  
Programming can make,  
A program to explain.  
  
From C++ to Java,  
From SQL to HTML,   
Programming is the key,  
To making things swell.  
  
A computer won't work,  
Without commands to follow,  
Programming can make,  
A computer to hallow.
