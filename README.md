### today's poem  
  
Programming, so much to learn  
A process that can be quite stern  
A language of ones and zeroes  
Code that can make the heart of a computer explode  
  
Syntax and commands that control  
The power to manipulate and make things whole  
A sequence of instructions to fulfill a goal  
A complicated set of rules  
  
Debugging can be a long task  
But the joy of making it work is worth the ask  
Coding is something that will last  
A language of beauty and grace  
  
To program is to create  
A skill that is hard to replicate  
A way of thinking to truly innovate  
An art that will never be replaced
