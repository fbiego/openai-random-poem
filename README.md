### today's poem  
  
Programming,  
A language of ones and zeros,  
A language of syntax and strings,  
A language we use to create.  
  
Complex structures and systems,  
Able to do many things,  
Coding and algorithms,  
Achieving most anything.  
  
Debugging and testing,  
Making sure the code works,  
Re-writing and improving,  
Till the project it lurks.  
  
Programming,  
A language of innovation,  
A language of creativity,  
A language of the future.
