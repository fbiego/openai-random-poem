### today's poem  
  
Programming is a skill of precision,  
A craft of logic and decision,  
A set of commands and syntax,  
Coding can be quite complex.  
  
Some of us spend hours and hours,  
Solving problems with immense powers,  
To create something from the heart,  
That will make the world a better place to start.  
  
It's a language of numbers and symbols,  
A way of communication and thought that overwhelms,  
It's a system of thought, logic, and design,  
That can help us make something that's truly divine.  
  
You can create a website, a mobile app,  
Or a game that will give you a great clap,  
You can create something that will never stop,  
And will be a part of the world's top.  
  
Programming is an art,  
A way of expressing yourself and to start,  
A way to create something beautiful,  
That will make the world more colorful.
