### today's poem  
  
Programming, oh programming,  
My favorite task of all  
Combining logic, creativity,  
To create something grand and tall  
  
I learn from my mistakes and successes,  
And I'm always eager to try  
To create something of my own,  
Just like the birds in the sky  
  
The lines of code, the empty screen,  
I just have to try  
Programming is my passion,  
It's a part of me, I can't deny  
  
So when I'm feeling overwhelmed,  
I look down at my hands  
For I know that programming is  
A beautiful art that never ends.
