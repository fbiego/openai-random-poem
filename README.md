### today's poem  
  
Programming is a skill that I can do  
Logic and syntax that I can pursue  
Objects, classes, and modules too  
All the coding I can do  
  
Making functions, strings and ints  
Conditions, loops, and if-else statements  
Data types, lists and dictionaries  
I'm sure this is something I can master easily  
  
Debugging and testing, troubleshoot and fix  
Compiling and running, I won't miss  
Solve problems and create an app  
Programming is a skill that I can boast  
  
No matter the language, I can learn and understand  
Algorithms, data structures, and more I can command  
Developing and coding, I'm here to stay  
Programming is something I won't forget any day
