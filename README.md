### today's poem  
  
Programming is a wonder,  
A feat of human design,  
To create a machine so clever,  
And give it a mind.  
  
It has the ability to think,  
To process and perform,  
To solve any mathematical problem,  
And do so out of the norm.  
  
It can find solutions for puzzles,  
With data it can crunch,  
It can recognize patterns for us,  
In every bit and hunch.  
  
It can make decisions for us,  
With logic and its might,  
It can help us make progress,  
In our daily plight.  
  
Programming is a marvel,  
A craft of human kind,  
To create a machine so wise,  
And give it a mind.
