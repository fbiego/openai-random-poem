### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a sweet honeycomb  
With loops and ifs and variables galore  
The syntax like a puzzle to decode  
A challenge to explore  
  
A language to learn and a skill to refine  
Programming can open up a whole new world  
From a simple HTML tag to complex algorithms  
It is fun to take a whirl  
  
A website, an app, a game, or a tool  
Programming can make it all  
Bringing ideas to life, it's really quite cool  
An interesting art to enthrall   
  
Programming is never quite the same  
A unique experience each time  
A way to express yourself, a way to create  
Programming is quite sublime!
