### today's poem  
  
Programming, you're like a puzzle  
A challenge that I can't refuse  
You present me with a muddle  
And I will try to cut through the noose  
  
You test my knowledge and my patience  
You make me think in a different way  
You test my understanding and my convictions  
And make me work late into the day  
  
Your languages are like a foreign tongue  
One I must learn to understand  
You push me to my limits  
But I will never give up at hand  
  
You are the key to unlock  
The doors of technology's future  
You are the lifeblood of knowledge  
And you will always be my tutor
