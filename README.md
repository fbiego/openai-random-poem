### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle to me  
A series of codes and logic set free  
Filled with ifs, fors and whiles  
It's a language that can take many miles  
  
My brain feels engaged when I'm coding  
It's like a game that I'm exploring  
The debugging and the challenges  
Are what I live for in my coding experiences  
  
Programming lets me be creative  
It gives me a way to be innovative  
I can come up with ideas and see them through  
My creative juices begin to brew  
  
Programming is a language so powerful  
It gives me the ability to be so resourceful  
My coding skills are my pride and joy  
My work is my own beautiful toy
