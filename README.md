### today's poem  
  
Programming, oh coding so sublime  
Like a chess game, but with less time  
To think and to plan, the logic to start  
The syntax and structure, and the code to part  
  
The screen is your canvas, and all of the tools  
To create something new, with such great rules  
Put together the pieces, to make a whole  
An application that can take control  
  
No matter the problem, no matter the size  
Your mind is the weapon, the force is your eyes  
To find the solutions, the logic to solve  
Programming is key, and it's yours to evolve  
  
The languages of code, the ones you can learn  
Are the key to success, and a path you must earn  
The ideas and concepts, the concepts to grasp  
Are the building blocks, of your future's maps  
  
Programming, oh coding so sublime  
It's the key to success, and that is no lie  
So take up the challenge, and get off the ground  
It's time to code, and make a sound!
