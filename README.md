### today's poem  
  
A computer is what I use,  
To program and debug,  
Without any excuse.  
  
My lines of code,  
Are like a poem of prose,  
That will run,  
Wherever it goes.  
  
I open my project,  
And pick the right language,  
Then I start to type,  
With my fingers a-swaying.  
  
I write and debug,  
My functions and class,  
To ensure my program,  
Will run with no hassle.  
  
I have my variables,  
And my if-statements too,  
To make sure my program,  
Will not be blue.  
  
When I'm done,  
I'll have a program,  
That will run,  
And all will be grand.
