### today's poem  
  
Programming, a language of its own  
A code of logic and rules unknown  
A challenge to understand just what it means  
A task to take on with all that it entails  
  
If you want to create something truly grand  
A complex command structure to command  
A world of imagination, a place of play  
Where your code will be tested day by day  
  
A coder, a master, a craftsman of tech  
A builder of apps and websites galore  
A maze of codes, commands, and syntax  
A puzzle that must be figured out more  
  
Programming, a language of its own  
A key to unlock all of the doors  
A challenge to complete and a goal to reach  
A reward that only comes with the knowledge you teach.
