### today's poem  
  
A language of numbers and symbols so strange  
A puzzle and challenge each time you arrange  
A program to be created and written anew  
A world of possibilities awaits you  
  
A series of commands, from a to z  
A pattern of thought that is so unique  
A formula of coding, each step so precise  
A program that will work is your prize  
  
A vision of ideas, a problem to solve  
A journey of programming, there's no one to solve  
A set of instructions to guide you along  
The logic to make it all strong  
  
A structure of syntax, a line at a time  
A puzzle that's waiting to be solved in its prime  
A program that works, a job well done  
The thrill of success, the satisfaction's won!
