### today's poem  
  
Programming is a deep, dark abyss  
It can open and close like a fist  
  
It's a powerful tool in the hands of the wise  
It can even surprise the most sophisticated eyes  
  
It can bring order, or it can bring chaos  
It can build a house, or it can blow it apart  
  
It can make us laugh, or it can make us cry  
It can make us think, or it can make us fly  
  
Programming is a language all its own  
It can be learned, but it's never fully known  
  
It can be a friend, or it can be a foe  
It can make us think, or it can make us slow  
  
Programming can be an art, or it can be a science  
It can be a challenge, or it can be a nuisance  
  
It can create beauty, or it can create destruction  
It can bring joy, or it can bring disruption  
  
Programming is a powerful force that must be respected  
It can be a blessing, or it can be a curse  
  
For those that understand it, there are few things more rewarding  
It can make you feel like a king, or it can leave you feeling bored
