### today's poem  
  
Programming, the sweetest of arts,  
A craft of the modern age  
It brings forth life from lines of code  
To solve problems, big and small  
  
We tinker and we tweak,  
We type and debug  
Our codes, a perfect mix  
Of syntax and logic  
  
For those who have the skill  
It can be a magical thing  
Instructions for the machine  
To do the most amazing things  
  
We can build robots and apps  
We can make a virtual world  
We can even take to space  
With the power of programming  
  
So if you want to learn  
To create something new  
Programming is the way  
To make your dreams come true
