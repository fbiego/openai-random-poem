### today's poem  
  
Programming, the dark art of code  
Twisting ones and zeros, a strange abode  
From the depths of a computer, a powerful beast  
A language of symbols, to the least  
  
A syntax of commands, that must be obeyed  
A structure of logic, to make a program played  
A program to run, to make it do  
A script of code, to make it true  
  
For a web page to show, or a phone to ring  
A program to write, is the only thing  
To play a game, or make a site  
Programming is the only light  
  
To make a computer, a thing of life  
Programming is the tool, to end the strife  
A language of logic, to set things right  
The power of code, to bring the night
