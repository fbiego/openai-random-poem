### today's poem  
  
Programming how I adore thee  
Thou art the lifeblood of me  
The only thing that makes my heart beat  
My brain's sweet honey, oh so sweet  
  
I love the challenge in each line  
To make it all turn out just fine  
From the coding to the debugging  
It's like a game of hide and seek  
  
Though it may have its ups and downs  
We'll continue to work towards the crown  
The pride in knowing just what you've done  
For something that's already won  
  
Programming, my love for thee  
Will never for a moment leave  
The joy of knowing I can make  
A difference, oh, what a stake!
