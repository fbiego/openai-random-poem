### today's poem  
  
Programming, you are a masterful  
Skill that takes your time and patience  
Lines of code that can be so daunting  
But written with care, will be amazing  
  
Your logic is complex, yet so sublime  
Your syntax, your style, it's all mine  
Computer instructions, written out in time  
Form a program, that works so divine  
  
From games to apps, to websites too  
You can find a use for programming, that's true  
Creating a software, that's so new  
It's a challenge, and an adventure too  
  
You have to learn, and that's no lie  
But the rewards, will make you fly  
Your understanding, will make you wise  
Programming, you are a must to try
