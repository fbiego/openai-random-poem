### today's poem  
  
Programming can be a creative thing,  
To make a game or a website sing.  
Write some code and see what it brings,  
Then watch it come to life and take wings.  
  
You can make a website for a store,  
Or a game with lots of features galore.  
Create an app or help a friend,  
And watch your code come to its end.  
  
Programming can help you understand,  
The logic behind commands.  
Debugging is the key to success,  
When something is not quite right, I guess.  
  
Programming is a fun and complex art,  
It can help you create with your heart.  
It can help you solve problems great and small,  
And create something that will enthrall.
