### today's poem  
  
Programming so complex,  
A language so strange,  
Creating algorithms,  
It can feel quite deranged.  
  
Writing lines of code,  
Creating something new,  
Making a program come alive,  
It's a feat to do.  
  
From a silly game,  
To a useful application,  
Programming can help you,  
In almost any situation.  
  
It can be quite tedious,  
But the end result is worth it,  
Programming can be fun,  
If you don't give up on it.
