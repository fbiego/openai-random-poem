### today's poem  
  
Programming is my passion,  
My coding skills are vast,  
My programs always run,  
So I can work and last.  
  
My code shines like a diamond,  
It's written with care,  
Creating something out of nothing,  
That I can be proud to share.  
  
I make complex algorithms,  
That look so very simple,  
To solve problems that arise,  
In a way that's quite nimble.  
  
Programming is an art,  
And I'm the artist here,  
Writing code that will stand the test of time,  
For years and years to come, and never fear.
