### today's poem  
  
The logic of programming  
It's a language of its own  
A web of words and numbers  
A place to call my home  
  
Coding and debugging  
These are the tools I use  
To create a world of software  
From a universe of clues  
  
The syntax is precise  
The strings of code aligned  
To build something grand and complex  
From a small idea combined  
  
It's a challenge and a thrill  
To build a program that works  
But it's worth the effort  
When the result is something that lurks  
  
A program that's reliable and secure  
To solve a problem or two  
That's the reward of programming  
That I'm eager to pursue
