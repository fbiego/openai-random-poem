### today's poem  
  
Programming, thou art a mystery,  
A master of algorithms, thou art a history  
A language that can be learned,  
But to master it is hard,  
For it requires a mind full of knowledge and a heart of a bard!  
  
Programming, thou art a challenge,  
A skill that requires a balance,  
It teaches one to think,  
And how to link,  
Syntax, variables, and functions in a blink!  
  
Programming, thou art a joy,  
Where one can deploy,  
An app or a website,  
That can solve a plight,  
A puzzle that brings pleasure and delight!  
  
Programming, thou art a friend,  
One that never ends,  
A tool to explore,  
A way to soar,  
A field that's full of wonder and lore!
