### today's poem  
  
Programming is a puzzle so deep  
A game of sorts, a haiku of code  
A puzzle like no other, so complex  
A game of logic, skill, and flow  
  
A game of understanding, of patience, of logic  
A time-consuming endeavor, no doubt  
A journey of trial and error, but progress  
A journey that leads to a great reward  
  
A reward of satisfaction, accomplishment  
A reward of a job well done  
A reward that comes from hard work and dedication  
A reward that gives you a feeling of pride  
  
Programming is a puzzle so deep  
A game of sorts, a haiku of code  
A challenge like no other, so complex  
A game of logic, skill, and flow.
