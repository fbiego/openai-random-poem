### today's poem  
  
Programming is not an easy task,  
It takes time and dedication from the start.  
Each line of code is like a puzzle,  
A challenge to the programmer's heart.  
  
From the simplest to the most complex,  
The challenge is to make it work.  
To debug and solve the errors,  
And to make the code look good.  
  
Programming is an art form,  
The coder the artist's brush.  
The program the painting,  
A masterpiece or a complete rush.  
  
Sometimes the code fails,  
But that's no reason to be sad.  
Just find the problem and fix it,  
Try, try again until it's perfect and glad.
