### today's poem  
  
Programming, you are my friend  
You help me to comprehend  
The mysteries of the digital world  
And make my projects unfurl  
  
You help me automate tasks  
In ways that no one else asks  
You help me to create and solve  
In ways no one else could evolve  
  
You give me the power to unlock  
The secrets of a digital rock  
You give me the ability to code  
The most complex of digital abodes  
  
You help me to express my ideas  
In ways that no one else sees  
You help me to build and design  
In ways no one else would define  
  
Without you, my projects would be dull  
But you help me to make them full  
Without you, my projects would fail  
But you give me the tools to prevail
