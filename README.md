### today's poem  
  
We code in the night   
Pushing pixels and bytes  
Programming with delight   
The errors we fight  
  
We create with our minds   
And watch our dreams take flight  
A world of our own design   
We set things right  
  
We craft with our hands   
Elegant and precise  
Inventing new lands   
A place to find peace  
  
We make with our hearts   
A home in the sky  
Where the code never parts   
Our vision won't die  
  
We write with our souls   
The future is now  
Our journey unfolds   
We know how to wow
