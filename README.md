### today's poem  
  
Programming, a language of the future  
A language that can easily be sutured  
A language that is so complex and deep  
That its power will help us to leap  
  
A language that is so versatile and vast  
That it can help us with tasks of the past  
A language that can help us build a better future  
A language that is sure to be a tutor  
  
Programming, a language of the future  
A language that can help us to nurture  
A language that can help us to innovate  
And create a better world, free from hate  
  
A language that can make the impossible possible  
A language that can be used to break our walls  
A language that can be used to make a change  
And make our lives better in an exchange  
  
Programming, a language of the future  
A language that can help us to nurture  
A language that can help us to create  
A language that will help us to innovate.
