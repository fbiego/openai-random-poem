### today's poem  
  
Programming is my art, my passion, my life  
A way to make things happen, a way to make things right  
A way to create and explore, a way to learn from mistakes  
A way to express my thoughts, emotions, and dreams  
  
Programming is a language, a syntax, a way to communicate  
A way to give life to my ideas, to make them real  
A way to make things work, a way to make things happen  
A way to bring my vision of the world to life  
  
Programming is creativity, logic, and structure  
A way to shape my ideas, to bring them to fruition  
A way to communicate with the world, a way to share my knowledge  
A way to make something out of nothing and make a difference  
  
Programming is a journey, a challenge, a reward  
A way to explore and discover, a way to learn and grow  
A way to push the boundaries, to see what I can do  
A way to make a mark and make my dreams come true
