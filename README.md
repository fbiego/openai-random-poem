### today's poem  
  
Programming is an art,  
A way to create and impart,  
A way to make a machine  
Do what you want it to be seen.  
  
It's a way to craft something new,  
Something to make others view,  
A way to make a machine  
Do what you want it to be seen.  
  
It's a way to make something grand,  
Something to make others understand,  
A way to make a machine  
Do what you want it to be seen.  
  
It's a way to craft a masterpiece,  
Something to make other's minds cease,  
A way to make a machine  
Do what you want it to be seen.  
  
Programming is an art,  
A way to create and impart,  
A way to make a machine  
Do what you want it to be seen.
