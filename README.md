### today's poem  
  
The zeros and ones, the lines of code  
A language of machines, never growing old  
The endless algorithms, the endless search  
A journey of understanding, ever so complex  
  
The logic, the structure, the order of things  
The equations, the patterns, the way things cling  
The puzzles to solve, the paths to explore  
The challenges that arise, and the questions galore  
  
The compiler, the debugger, the tests to run  
The design, the build, the creation begun  
The rush of success, the thrill of the find  
The moments of joy, the moments so kind  
  
The world of programming, a world of its own  
A world of possibilities, a world to be known  
A world of exploration, a world of delight  
A world of discovery, an infinite sight.
