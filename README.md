### today's poem  
  
A program can be like a story  
Unfolding with an unwritten glory  
From its lines of codes so tiny  
Unlock the door to a world divinely  
  
From the keyboard to the screen  
The program comes alive and keen  
An algorithm the heart of it all  
The logic sets the program's call  
  
The program's flow with an artful grace  
The variables, they each have a place  
The looping through the code, so neat  
The program runs, complete  
  
The program's goal is achieved, at last  
A sense of joy, the programmer's cast  
From a computer's mind, a magical thing  
A program, a blessing to the world bring.
