### today's poem  
  
Programming is a tool,  
To make computers go,  
To make a website look cool,  
Or to create a video game show.  
  
It can make a spreadsheet,  
To organize all data,  
Or to create a calculator,  
So you don't have to wait.  
  
Programming can be powerful,  
Creating endless possibilities,  
It can even make a robot,  
To do your daily chores with ease.  
  
Programming can be tedious,  
The syntax can be a pain,  
But once you understand it,  
You can do anything you can imagine.
