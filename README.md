### today's poem  
  
Programming, so much to learn  
A language that's ever changing  
  
A complex web of syntax and commands  
A never-ending task of understanding  
  
From zero to hero, create code of might  
To wield the power to make things right  
  
Function by function, line by line  
The task is daunting and hard to define  
  
But the rewards are great, be it a game  
Or a program that can do the same  
  
The feeling of success, when the program works  
Is like a wave, a wave that jerks  
  
From coding and debugging, to design  
Programming is a skill that's divine
