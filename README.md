### today's poem  
  
Programming is a complex art  
It is the language of computers smart  
It is a way to solve problems great  
And it's used in every sector of late.  
  
It is a skill that is in high demand  
And it can be a part of any grand plan  
It's used to create things that are unseen  
And its effects are far reaching and keen.  
  
It's a way of bringing ideas to life  
And it's a way of making things right  
It's a way to make the world more efficient  
And it's a way to make a big difference.  
  
It's a way to make technology advance  
And it's a way to take a chance  
It's a way to make the future bright  
And it's a way to make things right.
