### today's poem  
  
Programming is a skill that's hard to learn  
It's a deep realm full of knowledge to earn  
It's not just a skill, but a way of life  
That can open up so many opportunities in life  
  
It can help you build websites, apps, and games  
It can help you build machines and planes  
It can help you create something you never thought possible  
And help you make the world a bit more accessible  
  
It's a skill that requires hard work and discipline  
To make sure you can master the syntax and principles  
It can help you make a difference in this world  
And make your ideas come to life and unfurl  
  
Programming is something that you can do  
It can help you make a career out of something you love too  
So take the time to learn it, no matter how long  
It will be a skill you'll use for life and for which you will be strong.
