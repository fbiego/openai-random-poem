### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a chess game of code,  
A battle of wit and logic to explore  
Its like a puzzle to solve, and the right moves to make  
To guide the computer and get the desired result you take.  
  
From strings to classes, algorithms to loops,  
Syntax and structure, its a battle you must choose  
To create something from nothing, and do it with precision  
To get it all right, you must use your intuition.  
  
Memory management and data structures,  
Threads and debugging, you must endure  
To learn and understand the language of the machines  
You must be patient and never lose your dreams.  
  
Programming is a challenge, and a great adventure  
Where you must keep at it, and never waver  
For it can be a journey of creativity and joy  
Where you can make a mark and make the world employ.
