### today's poem  
  
Programming is a form of art,  
Tapping into the power of the heart,  
Manipulating data with ease,  
Bringing forth a digital breeze.  
  
From the start of a simple line of code,  
To a beautiful output that we can boast,  
Programming lets us explore and create,  
A world of possibilities that can hardly wait.  
  
We can search for answers,  
We can create games,  
We can create websites,  
We can even calculate the weather!  
  
Programming is a powerful tool,  
Creating wonders at the drop of a hat,  
It's a form of expression,  
That can open up a world of possibilities, all that.
