### today's poem  
  
Programming is a noble quest,  
A way to make the world invest  
In creativity and logic combined,  
To make something others can't find.  
  
A language of its own to learn,  
Lines and symbols to discern.  
The code is the key to success,  
It'll take you to the best.  
  
A structure of if and else,  
Of for and while and more.  
It takes time to master the art,  
But the rewards are quite a start.  
  
You'll create things from nothing at all,  
Things that many thought could not be done.  
But with programming, you'll prove them wrong,  
It's the way to go, so come along!
