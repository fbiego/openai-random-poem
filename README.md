### today's poem  
  
Programming can be a challenge,  
A puzzle waiting to be solved,  
A task that can take hours,  
The lines of code that must be involved.  
  
It's logic and precision,  
A science of its own,  
Writing code that can be read,  
A skill that must be known.  
  
For a programmer to succeed,  
Organization is key,  
The details that make a program complete,  
The little things that set it free.  
  
The satisfaction of a job done,  
A task that looks complete,  
Programming can be a struggle,  
But to some, it's a feat.
