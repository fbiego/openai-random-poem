### today's poem  
  
The gentle hum of the computer  
A soothing sound that's rarely heard  
The code that I type in the terminal  
That can make the machine absurd  
  
The logic of the programming language  
Can seem daunting at first glance  
But with the right mindset and the perfect plan  
It's a skill I can enhance  
  
The syntax that I learn and practice  
Can be used to create anything  
From a website to a game to a glorious app  
That will make life more exciting  
  
Programming isn't something that's easy  
It requires hard work and dedication  
But when the code finally works just like it should  
It's a feeling of elation  
  
The creativity and knowledge of programming  
Will help me to succeed  
And I'm proud of the skills I have acquired  
That will help me to succeed
