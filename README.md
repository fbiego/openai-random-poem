### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle,  
A game that I play,  
I can create anything,  
If I put my mind to it and I play.  
  
My ideas are like stars in the sky,  
If I focus I can make them fly,  
To the code I will add,   
And the program will come alive.  
  
I am the master of my domain,  
I can create anything from the mundane,  
No matter how hard the task may be,  
Programming is the key.  
  
I can make a world filled with fun,  
A place where everyone can come,  
No matter what game I decide to make,  
The challenge is what will make programming great.
