### today's poem  
  
Programming,  
A language so grand,  
It can make a robot,  
Do what you demand.  
  
It can control a drone,  
Or make a website,  
It can help a scientist,  
Or bring a game to life.  
  
Programming is powerful,  
It can do so much,  
It can make our lives easier,  
With a simple touch.  
  
It's an art and science,  
Combined together,  
Programming can make,  
Our lives much better.
