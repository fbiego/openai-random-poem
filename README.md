That can be hard to understand  
But with the right tools and knowledge  
You can make incredible things that are grand  
  
With lines of code, variables and strings  
You can build apps and websites that truly sing  
You can create games and tools that help us in life  
By programming, you can bring joy and delight

Programming is a powerful skill  
So take it on and get your fill
