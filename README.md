### today's poem  
  
Programming, oh programming  
What is it really doing?  
Enabling our computers  
To do so much more than snoozing  
  
It helps us create things  
We never thought of before  
Spreading knowledge and wisdom  
To all the corners of the world  
  
It's not just about coding  
But also about problem solving  
Debugging and designing  
Developing and testing  
  
Programming, oh programming  
We can do so much more  
Unlock our imaginations  
And open unexplored doors
