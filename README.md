### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a tool  
It can help you to create a pool  
Of functions and variables galore  
To help with complex software  
  
Coding is like a language  
It requires time and patience  
To create a masterpiece  
That will impress us all  
  
Debugging is like a puzzle  
It can be difficult to juggle  
The syntax and semantics  
To make it all work  
  
Programming is like a key  
It unlocks the secrets of technology  
To unlock a world of possibilities  
And lead us to a brighter future
