### today's poem  
  
Programming is an art,  
Like a canvas, it can start  
A world from the ground up,  
Where all can be grown up.  
  
It is complex and intricate,  
And yet can give us a tech-based treat.  
It can bring forth a game,  
Or even a world of fame.  
  
But it can also be daunting,  
Where errors can be haunting.  
But don't let this deter you,  
There's much that can ensue.  
  
It's a world of possibilities,  
Where one can explore and explore endlessly.  
The sky is the limit,  
And with practice you can master it.
