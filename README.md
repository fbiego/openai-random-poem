### today's poem  
  
The computer is my friend,  
I'm learning to program,  
So that I can make it do my bidding,  
But sometimes, it just won't comply.  
  
I type in the code,  
And wait for the result,  
But sometimes, it just won't do,  
What I was expecting it to do.  
  
The debugging begins,  
I search for the bug,  
Sometimes it takes a while,  
But eventually I can make it smile.  
  
The errors get sorted,  
And the program runs,  
It's a great feeling,  
When the job is done.  
  
Programming is a challenge,  
But it's also a lot of fun,  
I'm getting better every day,  
My skills will never be done.
