### today's poem  
  
Programming is quite a task  
A world of ones and zeroes  
It takes a certain kind of skill  
To make the computer do as it chose  
  
From a simple "Hello World"  
To a complex program that can do   
It's amazing how much you can achieve  
In this electrical stew  
  
It's a field of creativity  
Where so much can be done  
You can build a website or a game  
Or a program to have some fun  
  
Programming requires dedication  
To problems you must attend  
But the reward of a working code  
Is a feeling that can't be surpassed in the end.
