### today's poem  
  
Programming, what a thrill  
Turning ideas into code  
Making computers do our will  
  
Creating websites and apps  
Game development, with no slaps  
The power to control our fate  
A skill that will never be too late  
  
The possibilities are endless  
From the tech giant to the small business  
That's what programming can do  
A skill that everyone should pursue  
  
A language of ones and zeros  
The potential for us to explore  
The future is so bright  
And programming will be its light
