### today's poem  
  
A language of its own,  
programming is the way  
to make things come alive,  
with a tap of the keyboard  
  
Black and white lines of code,  
each one a command of its own,  
bring our ideas to life  
in the blink of an eye  
  
From websites to applications,  
it all starts with a plan,  
determining what each line will do  
and how it all should connect  
  
Each primitive and object  
becomes a building block,  
so many intricate pieces  
that all fit together like a puzzle  
  
Coding is the magic  
that brings our dreams to life,  
a powerful tool in our hands  
to build whatever we can imagine
