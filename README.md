### today's poem  
  
My love of coding comes to me like a breeze  
It's like a language that I strive to decipher  
I am excited to be a programmer  
It's like a journey that I'll never end  
  
I learn the syntax and I understand  
My keyboard is my canvas and my code is my art  
I can create whatever I can imagine  
And watch my ideas come to life in the end  
  
I love problem solving and I'm always on the job  
My patience and persistence are what I rely on  
I debug my code and I'm never done  
My problems soon become solved in the sun  
  
Programming is my passion and I'm never bored  
It brings out my creativity and I'm always exploring  
I'm always on the lookout for new tricks  
My love for coding will never go away
