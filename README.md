### today's poem  
  
A program that's neat,  
A code that's complete,  
An algorithm that's sound,  
Will never let you down.  
  
A design that's tried and true,  
Will make your system run smooth,  
A program that's optimized,  
Will cause your system to run smooth.  
  
A syntax that's precise,  
Will make your code concise,  
A language that's clear,  
Will make your code appear.  
  
An interface that's friendly,  
Will make your user grin,  
A platform that's reliable,  
Will make your user win.  
  
A bug that's caught,  
Will make your program stay hot,  
And a system that's secure,  
Will make your user secure.  
  
Programming's a skill,  
That's worth mastering,  
It takes hard work and dedication,  
To become a programming sensation.
