### today's poem  
  
Programming, what a joy  
A task that I so enjoy  
Coding in the night  
With a cup of coffee in sight  
  
My mind is in a race  
I'm learning at a fast pace  
The syntax and the code  
My brain can barely hold  
  
The logic and the structures  
The algorithms and the lectures  
I'm gaining so much knowledge  
And putting it to use  
  
Debugging and problem-solving  
My brain is always evolving  
Computers I understand  
Programming is my command
