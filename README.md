### today's poem  
  
Programming, such a curious thing,  
A language I'm still learning to sing,  
From loops to classes, what a task,  
To understand while I'm still aghast.  
  
A language of symbols, and numbers too,  
So much to learn, what should I do?  
I sit and I ponder, I think and I type,  
My heart starts to flutter, I really do try.  
  
From Java to Python, I'm learning them all,  
My coding skills growing, feeling quite tall,  
Debugging and testing, a skill to be honed,  
I'm getting the hang of it, feeling so grown.  
  
Programming can be a challenge, I know,  
But I'm getting the hang of it, my skills really show,  
My confidence building, I'm sure I can do it,  
Programming, I'm ready, just watch me shoot.
