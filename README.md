### today's poem  
  
I'm a programmer, an engineer of sorts  
I'm the one who can develop the thought  
From a simple problem to a complex solution  
I can make something new with each iteration  
  
Creating algorithms and debugging codes  
I'm the one who makes sure it loads  
From a single line to a whole application  
I'm here to make your dreams a realization  
  
My work is complex and my coding is tough  
But I can make your project have no hiccups  
I'm a programmer, an innovator of sorts  
I'm the one who makes your ideas come to life in a sort
