### today's poem  
  
Programming, the language of machines  
A way to find lost meanings  
A way to make dreams come true  
A way to bridge the gap between worlds  
  
A way to bring a vision to life  
A way to create worlds unseen  
A way to make a difference  
A way to bring ideas to life  
  
The power of code and syntax  
The power to make and manipulate  
The power to find new solutions  
The power to make a complex task simpler  
  
Programming, the language of machines  
A way to share knowledge and ideas  
A way to make a lasting impact  
A way to create a better future.
