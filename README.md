### today's poem  
  
A code that is written with a plan  
To create something new and grand  
  
Creating a program that is smart  
To make the user's life start  
  
The programmer works with precision  
To build something with precision  
  
With loops and functions, iterating  
Making the user's life more exciting  
  
The programmer is the creator  
Of a world of endless possibilities  
  
Debugging and coding with care  
To make sure it's working out there  
  
Programming can be a mystery  
But it's always an adventure, you see  
  
Creating a program from start to end  
A program that will never bend
