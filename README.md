### today's poem  
  
Coding is a language so abstract  
A language that can do so much, yet so exact  
  
It's like a puzzle, a problem to solve  
But with the right code, you can make it evolve  
  
It's a skill that's ever-evolving and ever-growing  
A skill that is always changing and constantly flowing  
  
It's a way to express yourself, to explore and create  
A way to make something out of nothing, before it even was great  
  
It's a tool that can make systems, apps, and websites appear  
And it's a language that can make data become clear  
  
Coding is a skill that's becoming more and more important  
A skill that can bring ideas to life, no matter how distant   
  
It's a language of creativity, of innovation, and of thought  
A language that can transform the world, no matter how small or how large it's sought  
  
Coding is a language, an art, a science, and more  
A language of potential, that's truly for evermore.
