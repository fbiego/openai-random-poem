### today's poem  
  
A code, a language, a way to communicate  
A way to create, to animate, to innovate  
  
A skill to be learned, a challenge to be had  
A journey to be taken, a puzzle to be solved  
  
A tool to help automate, a way to make it right  
A way to make a difference, a way to make it bright  
  
A complex web of logic, a language to be spoken  
A way to make a dream, a way to make it happen  
  
Programming's power, it's a force to be reckoned  
It's the way to the future, a way to transcend
