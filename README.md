### today's poem  
  
A software engineer with a passion and a plan,  
With a head filled with ideas and a heart that's full of sand.  
  
A coder whose fingers work faster than the wind,  
Able to make a machine do things it never thought it could be.  
  
A programmer who solves puzzles and creates new worlds,  
Making the impossible possible with code and tools.  
  
A web designer who knows how to use colours and fonts,  
To captivate visitors and keep them wanting more.  
  
A data analyst who can find patterns and trends,  
Analyzing data to make sense of the unknown.  
  
A programmer who strives to push the boundaries of technology,  
Bringing innovation and progress to the world.  
  
A software engineer who doesn't rest until the job is done,  
Making a difference in the way we live and work.  
  
Programming is an art, a skill, and a passion,  
That will continue to inspire and change the world.
