### today's poem  
  
Programming is a thing of beauty,  
It's a way to make our dreams come true,  
To express our creativity,  
And to give us what we need to do.  
  
It's a language of machines and more,  
It's a way to solve and explore,  
From making websites to games galore,  
It's an art to which we can all adore.  
  
It's a way to make our lives better,  
To make something out of nothing ever,  
And to create things never before,  
It's an amazing feat like no other.  
  
We can use it to automate tasks,  
We can use it to build amazing apps,  
We can use it to make our future bright,  
And to make the world a better sight.  
  
So use your programming skills today,  
To make something that will stand the test of time,  
And to show the world that you have something to say,  
Because programming is a thing of beauty!
