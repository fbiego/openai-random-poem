### today's poem  
  
A world of ones and zeroes,  
A language of endless woes,  
Strange symbols on a page,  
An interlocking cage.  
  
A jumble of abstraction,  
A network of relations,  
A code of intricate parts,  
A puzzle for the smart.  
  
A process of deduction,  
A journey of production,  
A challenge of creation,  
A mind of computation.  
  
A field of potential,  
A chance to be essential,  
A start to something great,  
A chance to innovate.  
  
A language of machines,  
A way to make things unseen,  
A way to make them real,  
A way to make them feel.  
  
A way to shape the world,  
A way to make it whirled,  
A way to make it right,  
A way to code the night.
