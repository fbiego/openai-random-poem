### today's poem  
  
Programming, the language of machines,  
A way to bridge the human-computer dreams.  
From coding a website to a mobile app,  
Programming can do it all with a snap.  
  
It's a way to create and manipulate,  
It's a way to make an idea take shape.  
From a simple algorithm to a complex AI,  
Programming is the way to make it real.  
  
Programming is a way to build and grow,  
To problem-solve and learn as we go.  
It's a way to automate and streamline,  
To make the impossible possible in no time.  
  
Programming is a way to dream and explore,  
To go beyond what we know and can explore.  
So let's keep coding, and keep learning,  
Let's keep pushing the boundaries as we go.
