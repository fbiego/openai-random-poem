### today's poem  
  
This puzzle of code,  
A struggle of logic,  
A journey of thought,  
A never-ending cycle of learning.  
  
A language of numbers,  
A language of symbols,  
A vast world of possibilities,  
My mind is a playground of creativity.  
  
An infinite loop of understanding,  
A complex symphony of debugging,  
A window of exploration,  
My life is a quest to find the answer.  
  
A challenge of simplicity,  
A maze of possibilities,  
A world of complexity,  
My heart is a language of understanding.  
  
A path of knowledge,  
A test of intelligence,  
A race of innovation,  
My destiny is to be a programmer.
