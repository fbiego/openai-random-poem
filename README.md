### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language of the future  
A way to code and make things come alive  
To create something with a few simple lines  
That can be used to help mankind thrive  
  
It’s a creative outlet to explore and discover  
A language full of complexity and fun  
Where you can make a computer do your bidding  
And watch it come to life in the sun  
  
You can build websites, apps and more  
And learn from others in the community  
Take part in hackathons and join the fray  
To create something really unique  
  
Programming is a language of the future  
A powerful tool for us all to use  
It’s a way to make the impossible possible  
And to build a better world for us to choose.
