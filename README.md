### today's poem  
  
Programming, a language of its own,  
A language of ifs, ands, and buts,  
A language of logic and reason,  
A language you must learn to love.  
  
A language of numbers and symbols,  
A language of rules and commands,  
A language of structure and order,  
A language that expands.  
  
A language of syntax and semantics,  
A language that needs deciphering,  
A language that's ever changing,  
A language of surprises and wonders.  
  
A language of creativity and innovation,  
A language of exploration and discovery,  
A language of problem solving and solutions,  
A language that's so necessary.  
  
Programming, a language of its own,  
A language that's worth the time,  
A language of endless possibilities,  
A language that's truly sublime.
