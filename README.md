### today's poem  
  
My code is like a puzzle  
Filled with unknowns and clues  
Its pieces fit together  
In a way I can't refuse  
  
I'm solving problems every day  
Making something from nothing  
My mind is a playground  
Where my ideas are bouncing  
  
As I type out the commands  
The logic takes its shape  
My lines of code form together  
Till the problem I can rape  
  
I'm debugging as I go  
To make sure my program runs  
My brain is always working  
To make sure the output hums  
  
I love this thing I do  
Creating something from scratch  
Programming is my passion  
It's the fire I can't match
