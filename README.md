### today's poem  
  
Programming, a challenge of sorts  
A way to instruct computers to do our work  
From simple loops to complex algorithms  
It can be a daunting task, I won't deny  
  
A language of code that can be hard to master  
It requires an attention to detail and precision  
It's a way to communicate to the computer  
So that it can do what we desire  
  
Sometimes it takes long hours of trial and error  
To find the right combination of code  
But when you see the output and it works  
It's so satisfying, a feeling of joy  
  
Programming is a skill that's so useful  
With it you can create something special  
It can be used for good or for evil  
It's a power that we should use wisely
