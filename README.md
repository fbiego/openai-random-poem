### today's poem  
  
Programming, what a delight  
It's filled with logic and might  
  
We fill our minds with the code  
And make the machines explode  
  
We learn the syntax, its rules and its tricks  
We make the computers perform our tricks  
  
The endless power of technology  
Empowers us to be free  
  
We can make the websites run  
We can make the systems come undone  
  
Programming is an art and a science  
It's an incredible experience  
  
To code a website or a program  
It's a process that's really quite long  
  
We use our problem-solving skills  
To make our projects real  
  
Programming is a joy to use  
It's a tool that can't be abused  
  
We use our knowledge to create  
And make the world a better place
