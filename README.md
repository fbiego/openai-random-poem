### today's poem  
  
Programming is a work of art  
Using logic to make a start  
Logic gates, if-else, and while  
The code is a masterful style  
  
The power of algorithms  
The power of data too  
The power of the computer  
To make a task so true  
  
The language of code  
A user must understand  
To make the computer do  
What the user has planned  
  
Programming is a challenge  
Where logic must be strong  
To make a complex program  
That works all day long
