### today's poem  
  
Programming is a world of its own,  
A language of its own,  
Filled with ifs and fors and whiles,  
The code is a canvas,  
A masterpiece being crafted,  
A problem being solved,  
A journey being taken.  
  
The debugging, the frustration,  
The joy of seeing the program work,  
The puzzles, the challenges,  
The coding, the debugging,  
The learning and the teaching.  
  
Programming is an art,  
A skill to be mastered,  
A craft to be honed,  
A puzzle to be solved,  
A world to explore.
