### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle of life  
A way to express emotions and strife  
  
A way to make things easier  
A way to make the world much queerer  
  
A way to make the world a brighter place  
A way to bring people joy and grace  
  
A way to make the world a better place  
A way to give people a voice and a face  
  
Programming is my passion and joy  
A way to make things happen with a single ploy  
  
A way to solve the problems we face  
A way to make our lives a better place
