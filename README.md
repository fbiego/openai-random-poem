### today's poem  
  
Programming is a thing of beauty,  
A skill that's often overlooked;  
It's a way of making something from nothing,  
A challenge that can be unlocked.  
  
It's a puzzle that we must unravel,  
A quest that never ends;  
A way of making our ideas come alive,  
A journey of technological bends.  
  
It starts with a single line of code,  
A sequence of ones and zeros;  
A careful mix of symbols and symbols,  
A process that's both complex and simple.  
  
Programming is a way of life,  
A language that's constantly evolving;  
It's a tool of great power and might,  
A way of creating something new and exciting.
