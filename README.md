### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language of its own  
It's a complex system of numbers and symbols  
It's an art form, and a science rolled into one  
  
A language that speaks to the machines  
And tells them what to do  
It's a powerful tool that brings so much to the table  
  
It's a challenge to master, and it takes some time  
But it's worth the effort, when you start to see the light  
Programming opens up a world of possibilities  
  
So many doors are opened when you have the knowledge  
You can create anything you can imagine  
From the simplest of games to the most intricate websites  
  
Programming is a skill that can take you far  
You can craft your own future with it in your hand  
  
Take the time to learn it, and you'll find  
That programming can be your best friend.
