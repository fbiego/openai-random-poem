### today's poem  
  
Programming, the language of computers,  
A skill must be acquired to use it well,  
It's a challenge to the sharpest of minds,  
And rewards the ones who learn it best.  
  
It's the language of the future,  
A skill to help you get ahead,  
A way of life for some,  
A way to make the world your bed.  
  
It's the language of machines,  
A tool to make the impossible, possible,  
A way to make ideas come to life,  
And create something truly incredible.  
  
It's the language of logic,  
A way to solve problems with ease,  
A way to make your dreams come true,  
And life a life of ease and peace.  
  
Programming, the language of computers,  
A skill to help us progress and grow,  
It's the way of the future,  
A way to make the world a better place to know.
