### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language of its own,  
It's like a puzzle that must be sown,  
A challenge to decipher, it's never the same,  
A set of instructions, that must be tame.  
  
It can be complex and intricate,  
Sometimes it can be a bit of a fret,  
But if you have the patience and the time,  
You'll have your program running in no time.  
  
It can be a source of great joy,  
And sometimes it can be a bit of a ploy,  
It takes skill and knowledge to stay afloat,  
And to make sure the code is right, note for note.  
  
Programming is a wonderful thing,  
It's like singing a song that you can bring,  
To life with your ideas and your thoughts,  
And the tasks will be completed, no matter what the odds.
