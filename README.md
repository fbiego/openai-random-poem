### today's poem  
  
A machine of code and form,  
A language that will transform.  
A system of logic and thought,  
That will never be forgot.  
  
A way to solve a problem,  
A way to create a realm.  
A way to build something new,  
A way to make it true.  
  
A way to make decisions,  
A way to create visions.  
A way to bring ideas to life,  
To make a world without strife.  
  
A way to make something grand,  
To take a chance and take a stand.  
A way to make something new,  
A way to make it true.  
  
Programming is a way,  
To make your dreams come true today.  
A way to make the world a better place,  
With just a few clicks and a little grace.
