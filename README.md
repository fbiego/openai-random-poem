### today's poem  
  
My code is my creation,  
A masterpiece of precision.  
I debug the syntax,  
My code is so complex.  
  
I watch my programs come alive,  
Each line a different drive.  
From variables to strings,  
This coding is everything.  
  
My fingers fly across the keys,  
Debugging is a breeze.  
I'm a master at my craft,  
My code will always last.  
  
An algorithm is my friend,  
I use it time and time again.  
I nest my functions deep,  
My code is so very neat.  
  
My programs are complete,  
I can go ahead and sleep.  
For I know my code is right,  
And I'm a programmer tonight.
