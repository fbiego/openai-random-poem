### today's poem  
  
It's a world of code and circuits,  
A place of logic, numbers, and words.  
A language of symbols and instructions,  
A language of creativity, unseen by birds.  
  
A world of ones and zeroes,  
A world of ifs and else.  
A place of loops and functions,  
A place of logic, without a single worry.  
  
A world of variables and strings,  
A world of objects and classes.  
A place of methods and structures,  
A place that requires thoughtfulness.  
  
It's a world of programming,  
A world of writing and debugging.  
A language that can be overwhelming,  
But with the right approach, it is worth pursuing.
