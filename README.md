### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language of logic,  
A way to solve complex problems on the spot.  
It can take a while to learn,  
But once you do, you can create anything you think of.  
  
It's like a puzzle,  
That needs to be solved,  
Using a language of bits,  
And bytes that unfold.  
  
It's a game of trial and error,  
Until you get it right,  
But when you do,  
The feeling is truly out of sight.  
  
A program is like a masterpiece,  
A work of art,  
A masterpiece that you created,  
That really hits the mark.  
  
Programming is a language,  
That will take you far,  
If you use it properly,  
You can create a star.
