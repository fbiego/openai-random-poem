### today's poem  
  
A world of logic and of thought,  
Where the possibilities are not fraught,  
A universe of symbols and of signs,  
Where the pathways and algorithms intertwine.  
  
A craft of structure and of syntax,  
Where the programs are so complex,  
A syntax to learn so you can understand,  
The power of the coding in your hand.  
  
The programs have a life all their own,  
Able to beat any challenge thrown,  
The challenge lies in writing the code,  
And the reward is seeing it unfold.  
  
A language of machines and of machines,  
Where the code is like a living dream,  
A world of programming and of code,  
Where the possibilities are truly broad.
