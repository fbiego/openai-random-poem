### today's poem  
  
Programming is a powerful art  
A way to create, express and impart  
Making something from nothing at all  
Though it takes patience and time to install  
  
You need to think logically and clear  
Though the journey can be long and appear  
To be more complex than you can understand  
It's worth the effort, this I demand  
  
Through writing code, a computer will heed  
Your commands, even if you can't see the need  
It's a complex puzzle that must be solved  
For it to work, of this there's no absolve  
  
Programming is a skill to be prized  
It takes hard work, and can't be disguised  
But with patience and dedication to learn  
It can make your dreams come true in turn.
