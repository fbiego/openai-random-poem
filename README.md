### today's poem  
  
I write code and build programs  
To make a computer do my bidding  
My fingertips dance along the keys  
Solving puzzles and problems with ease  
  
It's like a puzzle, a game of sorts  
I delight in finding the missing thoughts  
My mind works in mysterious ways  
Finding patterns and clever plays  
  
The computer obeys my command  
A powerful tool at my hand  
My ideas come to life  
When I write code and debug strife  
  
A world of possibility opens up  
As I learn and grow my cup  
Each bug I fix and line I write  
Gives me a new sense of delight
