### today's poem  
  
Programming allows us to create,  
A digital world of endless fate.  
  
Filled with promise, it's a delight,  
The possibilities are out of sight.  
  
To the uninitiated, it's a bore,  
But those who understand, crave for more.  
  
It's an exercise in problem-solving,  
Where the best solutions keep evolving.  
  
A code can be written, a game can be made,  
Programming is a skill that never fades.  
  
From a website to a mobile app,  
Programming is the key to the map.  
  
So whether you're using Java or Python,  
Programming is the language of the future, a given.
