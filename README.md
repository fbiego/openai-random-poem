### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language,  
It’s like a written dance.  
In code we can express,  
Our ideas and advance.  
  
It’s a way to create,  
A thing so great.  
We can build something new,  
And make it do what we want it to.  
  
Programming is a skill,  
That takes time and will.  
It is not easy,  
But it can be breezy.  
  
We can make something,   
From nothing at all.  
We write the code,  
And make it tall.  
  
Programming makes us think,  
It’s a way to link.  
It can be tough,  
But nothing is enough.
