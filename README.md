### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle,  
A complex web of code and fuss.  
It's a journey of discovery,  
A challenge that can't be rushed.  
  
It takes dedication and skill  
To master the art of coding.  
Tracing through lines of code,  
A skill that keeps on growing.  
  
The syntax and logic to learn,  
A language that requires patience.  
A world of possibilities,  
A realm of imagination.  
  
Programming can be daunting,  
But the rewards are worth the effort.  
Creating something from nothing,  
A truly wondrous art.
