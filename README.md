### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language all its own  
A code to be cracked, a puzzle to be known  
It's a way to build something from nothing  
A way to make something that's truly something  
  
A language of logic, and of rules  
A language with which to build and create tools  
The possibilities of what can be done  
Are limited only by the mind of the one  
  
From websites to apps, to games galore  
Programming is the way to explore  
The inner workings of a digital world  
Where you can make a mark, and be heard  
  
Programming is a gift, a way to create  
A way to express and to communicate  
A way to bring ideas to life  
A way to make something that's truly sublime
