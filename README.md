### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language so new,  
A logic that can make dreams come true.  
A way to bring the world alive,  
And help us make our dreams survive.  
  
A skill that makes the future bright,  
A means to make the wrongs right.  
Writing codes with precision and care,  
Creating something new and rare.  
  
A way to build a better tomorrow,  
A journey that will last and follow.  
Writing programs that can automate,  
An ever-growing source of fate.  
  
Programming is an art, you see,  
A way of life for you and me.  
A way to bring the world together,  
And make a better life forever.
