### today's poem  
  
Code is like a puzzle,  
It's a game of logic and wits,  
To solve it with precision,  
You need creative insights.  
  
You'll find a method,  
A way to make it work,  
It's like a machine in motion,  
That must be set in motion.  
  
You'll write the script,  
To automate the task,  
It may be tedious,  
But it's worth the ask.  
  
You'll take a problem,  
And solve it through design,  
With a few clicks and keystrokes,  
You'll make it shine.  
  
You'll debug the errors,  
And make it run just right,  
It's a challenge that's rewarding,  
When you finally get it right.  
  
You'll write the code,  
That will make the world go round,  
A program so powerful,  
That can't be found.  
  
Programming is a journey,  
A path of discovery,  
It's a way to create,  
What you didn't think possible to be.
