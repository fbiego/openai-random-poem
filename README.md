### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a secret language,  
It's like taking a journey through time and space,  
From the very first line of code,  
To the end of the debugging race.  
  
It's a challenge that never stops,  
To solve the puzzle and put the pieces together,  
A complex code of loops and stops,  
And all must work in harmony forever.  
  
Programming is like a riddle,  
A complex mechanism with many a quirk,  
But with patience and practice and a little bit of luck,  
You can create something that will really work.  
  
Programming is like a puzzle,  
It can be solved with a little bit of strategy,  
But it takes a special kind of person,  
To make something great out of the technology.
