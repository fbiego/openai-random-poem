### today's poem  
  
Programming is like building a bridge  
It's a way to cross the divide  
It can be complex and hard to understand  
But with patience a masterpiece can be designed  
  
It's a language that speaks in ones and zeroes  
A way to create something from nothing  
It can be a challenge and a test of your skill  
But in the end, it's a great feeling  
  
Programming is like a puzzle  
You have to put the pieces in the right place  
It might take some time but it pays off  
When you see the whole picture in space  
  
Programming is like a game  
It can be hard but it's also fun  
If you get stuck, just take a break  
And come back when you're done  
  
Programming can be a great tool  
For creating some amazing things  
It's a way to use your imagination  
And show the world what it brings
