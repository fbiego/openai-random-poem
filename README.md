### today's poem  
  
Programming's an art and a science  
With a rigorous structure and precision  
It's like a language, each line a phrase  
And through it, we can create anything we can imagine  
  
Computers are just tools, a bridge to our minds  
The power of logic can be hard to find  
But when we do, the world comes alive  
Telling stories and displaying data in an endless drive  
  
It's a blend of creativity and math  
Where the smallest of details can make or break  
It's a challenge to understand each line  
But it's all worth it for what we can design  
  
We can build a universe of our own  
Where the boundaries are ours to explore  
We can control the data and the flow  
And create something no one has explored before
