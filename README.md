### today's poem  
  
A programming poem, I will write  
For the ones who do it day and night  
  
They code and debug and make it right  
With languages such as Java and C++  
  
They make apps and websites oh so neat  
With a bit of HTML and some CSS sheet  
  
Sometimes they groan and sometimes they weep  
When their code just won't compile and won't beep  
  
But then when it works, the feeling so sweet  
A great accomplishment and a great feat  
  
These programmers are like wizards and magicians  
They create these great works of art and visions  
  
So here's to the programmers who make our world so bright  
Who are dedicated to their craft and work so hard day and night.
