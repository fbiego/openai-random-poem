### today's poem  
  
Programming is the act of creating  
Something from nothing, like a sculpting  
  
Writing lines of code that make something function  
A puzzle of logic that's a great construction  
  
A language that's made of ones and zeroes  
A code that can be used in many ways like heroes  
  
The syntax must be precise, everything in its right place  
A machine that can follow these instructions with grace  
  
Programming can be used to make a game  
Where the players are entertained, its never the same  
  
A language that can be used to make complex things  
A form of art in which the artist sings  
  
Programming may seem hard at the start  
But with practice you can become a master of art.
