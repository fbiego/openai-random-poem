### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle  
  
Solving it is such a hustle  
  
Assembling the code, making it flow  
  
Till it works as you want, in a row  
  
It's a challenge, a game, a fun pursuit  
  
The result is a code, that's cute  
  
It's a way to express yourself, you see  
  
Creating a masterpiece, that's free  
  
Programming can be simple, or complex  
  
It's a tool that can help you reflect  
  
It's a language you can use to create  
  
Something that's better than great  
  
So if you ever feel lost and confused  
  
Put your fingers to the keyboard and choose  
  
To write some code that's true and bright  
  
And make your ideas come to life.
