### today's poem  
  
Programming is my passion  
I never tire of the action  
My mind works in a fashion  
That I can never fathom  
  
The colors, the syntax, the code  
My fingers type it all like a pro  
No matter the language, I won't slow  
My programming skills make me so proud  
  
I can solve tricky puzzles  
My algorithms cause no hassles  
The code I write is so useful  
My skills bring me no troubles  
  
I'm a programmer by nature  
My code is my great feature  
My bugfixes are done with pleasure  
My coding is my great treasure
