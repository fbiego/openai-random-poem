### today's poem  
  
Programming is a journey,  
  
A search for understanding.  
  
It can be quite mysterious,  
  
Filled with puzzling demands.  
  
At times it can be tedious,  
  
But the reward is worth the cost.  
  
For the brave and patient souls  
  
Who can master the software's host.  
  
The syntax and the language,  
  
The logic and the flow.  
  
It can be quite confusing,  
  
But the challenge can be great fun to know.  
  
When you understand the power,  
  
The possibilities abound.  
  
You can create a new world,  
  
Where solutions can be found.  
  
So open up your mind,  
  
And dive into the code.  
  
The journey is long,  
  
But the reward can't be overstated.  
  
Programming is a journey,  
  
Where you will never truly end.  
  
A world of possibilities,  
  
A challenge that's hard to comprehend.
