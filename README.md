### today's poem  
  
Programming, a skill so fine,  
Creating something for all to find.  
  
The code, an art so magical,  
Bringing to life something digital.  
  
Computers, an ocean so deep,  
Programming the waves of its sea.  
  
The language, a world of its own,  
Creating something so grand and awesome.  
  
On the screen, it all comes alive,  
Making something out of nothing, a feat so sublime.  
  
Programming, a process so great,  
Creating something unique, a feat so grandiose.
