### today's poem  
  
Programming, oh programming  
A complex and mysterious thing  
That may seem daunting at first glance  
But is, in fact, an easy dance  
  
For it can be used to create  
Videos, websites, and apps so great  
An artist's canvas, some say,  
For those who'd rather code than play  
  
You can make the world a better place  
With a few lines of code and some space  
A puzzle to solve, a story to tell  
A way to express, a way to excel  
  
Programming is an art, it's true  
A language of ones and zeroes, too  
It takes time and dedication  
To make that dream a realization  
  
Programming, oh programming  
A complex and mysterious thing  
But with patience and understanding  
It can be an amazing thing
