### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language of its own  
It can be used to create a powerful tone  
The possibilities are endless, it's quite amazing  
From websites to apps, it can be used in many ways  
  
You can write down lines of code  
In C, Java, HTML, or Python mode  
The syntax is specific and the rules are strict  
But by following them, great things can be picked  
  
Programming is like a puzzle of sorts  
You have to put all the pieces in the right spots  
It can be a challenging task  
But the satisfaction of the result is worth it at last  
  
You can create your own world  
Full of buttons, texts, and other things  
You can design it from scratch  
And users can interact with it and get a kick  
  
Programming can be daunting at first  
But with practice and knowledge you can quench your thirst  
It's a complex but rewarding profession  
And with it, you can make your dreams come true with precision.
