### today's poem  
  
Programming, a puzzle of knowledge,   
A language that can be so profound   
In its own world, a place of solace,  
A way to create and make a sound.  
  
From syntax to logic, from pattern to form,  
To compile and debug, that's the norm.  
To type and test, to learn and explore,  
A challenge for both young and old.  
  
A way to create, with a mind so keen,  
A world of possibilities, a dream.  
To solve problems, a challenge to be seen,  
A way to express, to be creative and free.  
  
Programming, a language of the future,  
A way to explore, to create, and grow.  
A skill that can make us all astute,  
To build and design, to make something great, so bold.
