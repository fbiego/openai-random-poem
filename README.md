### today's poem  
  
Programming, a way to make things anew,  
A way to reach out to the world, to do  
Things that have never been done before,  
A way to push the boundaries, explore  
  
Computer languages, symbols, and codes,  
A way to make dreams appear, like roads  
To the future, with lines of code that connect  
All the people, ideas, and dreams we select  
  
Programming, a way to think in new ways,  
To take the things that we see and create  
Dreams and ideas, with a click of a key,  
Lines of code, that set us free  
  
Programming, a way to create,  
To make the things we want to see,  
From a tiny spark, to a raging flame,  
Programming is the way to make a change.
