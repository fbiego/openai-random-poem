### today's poem  
  
A programmer's life is a curious thing  
A world of ones and zeroes they bring  
Coding, debugging, and refactoring  
A system of logic, no need for adoring  
  
From the simplest of lines to the most complex  
It can take hours to get it just right, at best  
The syntax and structure must be sound  
An error message is never found  
  
The reward of a job well done  
Is a successful program under the sun  
The pride of knowing what you've created  
Has no price, it can't be rated  
  
The coder's domain is an ever-changing space  
A place of learning, of knowledge and grace  
A never-ending challenge, a puzzle to solve  
A world of logic, and the power to evolve.
