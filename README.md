### today's poem  
  
Coding is like art, I'm making it start  
Creating something from nothing, a brand new part  
  
It's a puzzle I'm solving, a complex game  
To craft something great, I must play my part  
  
Debugging the code, until it's the same  
I'm building something, with only my brain  
  
A program is born, it's my own creation  
I'm proud of my work, an amazing sensation  
  
Programming's a skill, it takes lots of practice  
It's a journey that's long, an ongoing process  
  
But the end result's worth it, when I see it done  
It's a project I built, with a lot of fun
