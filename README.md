### today's poem  
  
Programming, the skill of the ages  
Weaving lines of code on the pages  
Instructing computers to do our bidding  
Performing feats of automation, never so quickening  
  
Programming, the language of the machines  
Expressing their thoughts, so it seems  
Of ones and zeroes, a binary song  
Instructing the computer to go along  
  
Programming, the code of the future  
Forging a path for the computer to endure  
Weaving a web of complexity in a tapestry of data  
It appears, the computer's in charge, so beware of its fate  
  
Programming, the art of the wise  
Unlocking the secrets of the skies  
The power to control and create  
A tool of tremendous might, with no fate but its own fate
