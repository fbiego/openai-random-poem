### today's poem  
  
The code is my language, I know it quite well  
I type it with ease, I'm sure you can tell  
I'm not an expert, I'm still learning the ropes  
But I'm getting there, with a few missteps and hopes  
  
My skills are improving, my code gets more clean  
I'm feeling more confident, with each line I complete  
Though I may stumble, I'm sure I'll succeed  
I'm learning more and more, this language I read  
  
Programming allows me to create from the heart  
No other language can express it so smart  
It follows a logic, like math in a way  
Yet it's so expressive, my mind's in its sway  
  
The code is my language, I'm now quite adept  
It's a joy to write it, it's an art I respect  
I'm still learning more, it's a skill I can grow  
Programming's my passion, I'm sure you know
