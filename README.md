### today's poem  
  
A program in hand and a vision in mind  
You craft a new language, so diverse and so fine.  
You create a world full of ifs and of thens  
Where logic and reasoning have no end.  
  
You design a platform with features and such  
The possibilities are endless, it's almost too much.  
You debug the code and follow the specs  
Making sure that the program never wrecks.  
  
The user interface is easy to use  
You design it so that the user never has to choose.  
You write the code with a few simple clicks  
And make sure that the user never gets sick.  
  
A program is crafted and a vision is reached  
You have created a masterpiece that will teach.  
You can share it with others and watch it grow  
The programming world is just beginning to show.
