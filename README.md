### today's poem  
  
Programming's a strange thing  
A way to make a machine sing  
It's a language all its own  
A way to make things known  
  
It takes a certain kind of skill  
To write the code and make it real  
It's a science, an art, a craft  
To put the pieces in the right spot  
  
A program can make calculations  
And handle complex operations  
It can do things you never thought  
It can even be taught  
  
To teach a machine to think  
Can be quite a feat  
But it's a challenge that's worthwhile  
As it's often neat  
  
From spreadsheets to games  
Programming is the way  
To control the technology  
That's here to stay
