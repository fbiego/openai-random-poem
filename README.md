### today's poem  
  
Programming is an art,  
That allows us to think smart,  
A language of the mind,  
That’s truly divine.  
  
It’s a way to express,  
What we think and what we guess,  
A form of communication,  
That helps us form a great nation.  
  
We can write code to solve,  
Problems that seem to revolve,  
To build a bridge of trust,  
Wherever we must.  
  
It’s a challenge every day,  
Where we learn and also play,  
To create new things and make them right,  
To make our dreams come to light.  
  
Programming is a skill,  
That we must learn with will,  
It’s an investment of time,  
That will pay off in no time.
