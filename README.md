### today's poem  
  
A language of ones and zeroes,  
A syntax to decipher and codes to decode,  
The logic and problem solving skills come in handy  
For the programmer at work or at play.  
  
The creative and analytical mind  
Are the tools of a successful programmer  
The journey to mastering this craft  
Can be long and arduous.  
  
The debugging and testing of code  
Can be a tedious and time consuming task,  
But the satisfaction of creating something  
From nothing is worth the hard work.  
  
The output of a program  
Can be both useful and delightful,  
A wonderful feeling of accomplishment  
That no one can take away.  
  
So if you have the patience and determination  
To learn a new language of computers  
The world of programming  
Will welcome you with open arms.
