### today's poem  
  
Programming is like an art  
A puzzle to solve and a part  
It requires concentration and skill  
To make something that runs, without a spill  
  
The challenge of learning the code  
Can be daunting and hard to decode  
But once you understand the flow  
You can create something that can really go  
  
It's a language that's meant to be shared  
With a community that's always there  
To help you out when you're stuck  
It's an incredibly rewarding luck  
  
Programming has changed our lives  
Created a world that's full of surprises  
From apps to games and more  
Programming is a skill to explore
