### today's poem  
  
Programming, it's a new way of life  
A path of knowledge and strife  
It starts off with a simple line of code  
But soon there's a web of knowledge to unfold  
  
Data structures, algorithms, and more  
It's a world of its own, a new kind of lore  
Actions, functions, variables too  
It's a never-ending journey, with much to do  
  
If loops, if-else, and while  
It's a puzzle that's really quite a trial  
Troubleshooting, debugging, and testing  
It takes a lot of patience, but it's worth investing  
  
Languages of Python and Java  
It's a constantly changing landscape, that's always far  
And when all the lines of code are done  
It's a feeling of accomplishment, a job well done
