### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle to me  
A complex web of code that I must see.  
The logic that it takes to write  
Is something I can hold so tight.  
  
Behind the keyboard I can create  
A world of things that I can make.  
Lines of text are like a symphony  
Of which I have full mastery.  
  
As I type I can feel the power  
Of programming in its finest hour.  
I can create a wondrous space  
Where I can work at my own pace.  
  
I can design an amazing game  
Where all the rules are mine to tame.  
I can craft a beautiful site  
Where others can explore the night.  
  
Programming is my chosen route  
It's an ever-growing field of intrigue.  
As I learn I'm filled with joy  
That I can create my own world to deploy.
