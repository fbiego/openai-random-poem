### today's poem  
  
Programming, a language of code  
That can bend the rules of the world  
It's the engine that can make a dream,  
A dream that will never be furled  
  
You can create the craziest things,  
From a virtual world that sings  
To a car that can drive itself,  
A code that has no elves  
  
Programming is powerful and grand,  
It can move the world in your hand  
It can make a robot think,  
Or even make a river stink  
  
Programming is art and science,  
A tool to make the world advance  
It's a skill that's in high demand,  
From websites to a moon landing  
  
Programming is logic and reason,  
It's a language that's ever changing  
It's a tool to build and create,  
From a game to a plate  
  
Programming is the language of the future,  
A path that's full of adventure  
It will take you to places unseen,  
Where your dreams can become a reality.
