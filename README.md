### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language,  
A way to communicate,  
A way to understand,  
A way to create.  
  
It's a way to make things,  
To do things differently,  
To get it done,  
In the most efficient way possible.  
  
Programming is a way to explore,  
To think differently,  
To push the boundaries,  
And to make something new.  
  
It's a way to design,  
To build, and to test,  
To create something beautiful,  
In an organized mess.  
  
Programming is a way to express,  
To think and to solve,  
To make something from nothing,  
And to be creative as a whole.
