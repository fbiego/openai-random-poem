### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle,  
It's pieces just waiting to be put in their places,  
A long journey along many pathways,  
The code waiting to be released.  
  
A language of ones and zeros,  
A way to get the computer to do your bidding,  
A way to build systems,  
That will make the task you've been given, stop bidding.  
  
A skill that is complex and satisfying,  
It takes time, patience, and dedication,  
A skill that is ever evolving,  
A skill that will never be outdated.  
  
Programming is a way to solve problems,  
To create something from nothing,  
To create something that can help others,  
To make the world a better place.
