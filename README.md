### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a secret language,  
It's a cryptic code that looks strange.  
  
A complex puzzle to rearrange,  
But when put together it looks quite plain.  
  
A way to make computers do your bidding,  
Endless possibilities to explore.  
  
A way to make your own art,  
Reality made with code and more.  
  
A way to make your dreams come true,  
To better life and make it new.  
  
A way to make the world a better place,  
Through code and algorithms to trace.  
  
Programming is a powerful tool,  
It can help us reach our goals.  
  
A way to make things more efficient,  
From the simplest to the most complex.
