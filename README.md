### today's poem  
  
Programming, oh what a task  
It's a skill you cannot mask  
It's the way of the future, a language all its own  
Integrating with machines, to make them your own  
  
It's a process of learning, and a challenge to grow  
No matter the task, you'll need to know  
Variables, loops, and functions,  
Makes up a program of high precision  
  
You'll use logic and analysis,  
To debug those errors and anomalies  
It's a journey of exploration,  
To bring your dream into realisation  
  
Programming is a passion, a joy and a thrill  
It's a way to express your creative will  
It's a language of the tech world,  
A way to be creative, and a way to be heard
