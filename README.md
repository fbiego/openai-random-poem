### today's poem  
  
Programming is a great way to learn  
A language that's complex, yet so keen  
It opens up a world of possibilities  
A world of creativity  
  
Using logic and functions  
A world of structured control  
A world of loops and variables  
A world to explore and behold  
  
A world of algorithms and data  
A world of user-friendly design  
A world of languages to choose  
A world to challenge the mind  
  
Programming can do so much  
From websites to applications  
Programming is a powerful tool  
That will influence the worldâ€™s destinations
