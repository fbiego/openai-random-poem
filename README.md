### today's poem  
  
Programming is a skill  
So many complexities to fill  
The syntax can be a thrill  
A challenge to get it right  
  
But when it clicks, it's quite a sight  
A jumble of words and numbers  
Made sense of all of a sudden  
  
The logic behind the lines  
A puzzle to be defined  
A challenge to be faced  
The reward of an executed task  
  
A rush of accomplishment  
A feeling of being content  
This is what programming brings  
A sense of pride that it brings
