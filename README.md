### today's poem  
  
Programming like a puzzle,  
Forging new paths,  
Computers do what we ask of them,  
And oh, the math.  
  
Programming can be hard,  
But the reward is great,  
When the code is finally tamed,  
It's a feeling of elate.  
  
Programming has its challenges,  
But also its joys,  
So don't let the fear stop you,  
It's all part of the process.  
  
Programming is a language,  
Complex and unique,  
But the possibilities are endless,  
So, let's take a peek.  
  
Programming can be daunting,  
But with patience and skill,  
You'll be mastering the craft,  
And your code will be thrill!
