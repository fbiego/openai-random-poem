### today's poem  
  
Programming is the language of the future,  
It allows us to build what we can imagine,  
To explore the world, and search for its cure.  
  
We can create whatever we desire  
From simple webpages to complex networks,  
Where ideas can be shared and connected.  
  
It’s a powerful tool, yet so small,  
That it can fit in the palm of your hand.  
It’s a source of innovation and a way to understand.  
  
We can manipulate data and automate tasks,  
We can design algorithms and create powerful apps.  
It’s a journey of exploration and a never ending task.  
  
It’s a way to discover and to solve,  
A way to create and to develop.  
It’s a way to express yourself and your ideas evolve.  
  
Programming is the language of the future,  
It’s an incredible tool that can open many doors.  
A tool that will shape the world and so much more.
