### today's poem  
  
Programming, so mysterious and complex,  
A language of its own, a language of text.  
A puzzle to solve, a maze to traverse,  
A challenge to conquer, an adventure to pursue.  
  
A language of syntax and semantics,  
A language of logic and reason.  
A language of algorithms and equations,  
A language of innovation and progress.  
  
It can bring to life the wildest of dreams,  
And create a world of possibilities.  
It can help you to understand the world,  
Or create the world you want to see.  
  
Programming, so powerful and mysterious,  
A language that can be used to build and create.  
A language that can be used to explore and discover,  
A language that can be used to achieve great feats.
