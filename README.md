### today's poem  
  
Programming's my passion, my hobby and my game  
It's like a puzzle to me, and I just can't get enough of the same  
  
The logic and the syntax, the algorithms and the code  
It's like a language to me, a language I can decode  
  
I start with a problem, and I think how to solve it  
But I don't get it right the first time, so I often have to revise it  
  
Debugging's the worst, but I know I must persist  
But when the program finally compiles, it gives me such a bliss  
  
Programming's an art, a skill that I adore  
It's the one thing that I'm sure, I'll never get bored
