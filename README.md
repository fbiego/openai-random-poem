### today's poem  
  
Programming's what I do,   
It's my passion, my truth  
It's the key to the future,   
And the foundation of my youth.  
  
It's the language of computers,  
The language I adore  
It's the challenge that I take,  
To achieve something more.  
  
It's the engine behind the games,  
The fuel for the robots  
It's the brain of the machines,  
That never seems to stop.  
  
It's the language of the web,  
The fire that feeds the app  
It's the bridge between the past and the future,  
The force that'll never snap.  
  
It's the joy I get when I succeed,  
The thrill of something new  
It's the satisfaction of a job done right,  
My heart and soul, it's true.
