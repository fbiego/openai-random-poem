### today's poem  
  
From the depths of the coding abyss,  
We battle the bugs and the lists,  
The lines of code all amassed,  
We strive to make them last.  
  
We don't mind the midnight hours,  
We don't mind the midnight showers,  
The ones that turn the bits to bytes,  
In the search for computational highs.  
  
We balance the ones and the zeroes,  
We find the loops and the heroes,  
We strive for the perfect code,  
The one that never shows a single node.  
  
We debug when the machines crash,  
We test until we just can't stand,  
We make sure the software runs,  
And for that, our praises come.  
  
The challenge of programming is real,  
But it's the challenge that we must feel,  
The satisfaction of a job well done,  
Is the reward of a programming one.
