### today's poem  
  
I write the code  
I make it flow  
I create a program  
From my head to toe  
  
I debug and debug  
I search and I find  
My code works, I am proud  
My mind is on my grind  
  
I debug again  
I test and I try  
My code works, I rejoice  
I'm sure I won't cry  
  
I code and code  
My fingers move quick  
My passion for programming  
Is really quite sick  
  
I'm proud and I'm happy  
My brain is full of glee  
Coding is my passion  
And I'm so proud to be!
