### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle,  
A challenge to solve and juggle.  
  
You must think with precision,  
To find the best decision.  
  
It takes patience and a steady hand,  
To understand the commands.  
  
You need to be prepared,  
For any unexpected snare.  
  
The language of computers,  
Makes complicated tasks simpler.  
  
You must focus and strive,  
To make the code come alive.  
  
Programming is a skill,  
That requires lots of will.  
  
You'll be rewarded when the code runs,  
And you can proudly show off your work to everyone.
