### today's poem  
  
A program's like a living thing,  
It's born from a single line of code,  
So simple and yet so mundane,  
But it holds a world of possibilities untold.  
  
A program is a jigsaw puzzle,  
With pieces that must fit just right,  
A coder must be precise and careful,  
To make sure the program runs so light.  
  
A program can be a game,  
A way to keep its players entertained,  
Or it can be a tool,  
To help people get work done faster than before.  
  
A program can be a website,  
Where people come to browse and buy,  
Or an app, that helps them find their way,  
Wherever they may want to go.  
  
A program can be a machine,  
That can learn and adjust on its own,  
And with AI, it can even think,  
Doing more than we had ever known.  
  
A program can be anything,  
And do whatever we can dream,  
But without coding it won't take shape,  
That's why we should all learn to program.
