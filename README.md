### today's poem  
  
We write with code, so neat and precise  
To create things so creative and nice  
It's a language all its own, special and unique  
For those with the knowledge to seek  
  
We build interfaces and programs to run  
We make apps and websites, just for fun  
We debug errors, with logical thought  
For the code to work, it must be taught  
  
We use languages like Python and Java  
To develop creative solutions that make us laugh  
We use HTML and CSS, which can make us frown  
But with a bit of effort, things can turn around  
  
Programming takes patience and practice galore  
But when your code works, you can't ignore  
The satisfaction of success and the feeling of pride  
It's a reward that makes the journey worthwhile
