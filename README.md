### today's poem  
  
Programming is what my heart desires,  
A place of beauty, a world of fire.  
  
The logic of this language is a pleasure to behold,  
A game of cat and mouse, where my code is controlled.  
  
I can craft a world of my own design,  
Where I have control over every line.  
  
It's a challenge that I'm always up for,  
A puzzle that I'm eager to explore.  
  
With a few lines of code, I can make a dream,  
Where I get to be creative and it's quite a scene.  
  
The possibilities are endless and I must be brave,  
To create something special, something I can save.  
  
Programming is a journey that I must take,  
A never-ending one, that I will never forsake.
