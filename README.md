### today's poem  
  
I type into my keyboard  
Lines of code that will succeed  
Creating a program that does the job  
For users in need  
  
I check for syntax errors  
And debug the code  
Making sure each line is just right  
For it to run as it should  
  
I design a user interface  
In a way that's intuitive  
So that it's easy to use  
For those who are new  
  
Programming takes skill and knowledge  
To build a great app  
But when it's all said and done  
It's truly worth the hard work and effort.
