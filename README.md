### today's poem  
  
Programming, oh programming,  
A wondrous gift to me  
For when I make the right code  
It will set me free  
  
Creating a website  
Or a game for all to see  
Programming can do it all  
A world of possibility  
  
The world is my oyster  
I can do anything  
The sky is the limit  
My creativity will bring  
  
When I'm stuck and in a rut  
I can debug and debug  
And when I hit that final key  
I smile with a big hug  
  
Programming, oh programming  
A fantastic tool for me  
From a simple website  
To a game I can play endlessly
