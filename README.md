### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language of computers  
A way to make machines do our bidders  
Complex algorithms and code  
Can make any task much easier to encode  
  
Programming can be a challenge  
But the rewards can be so large  
It's a skill that's so much in demand  
And can bring the user a charge  
  
A programmer can work with ease  
On any task in any language  
Creating solutions to problems  
Is the mission of this range  
  
From websites to applications  
Programming knows no bounds  
The possibilities are endless  
With the right skills and sounds  
  
Programming can be fun and rewarding  
A way to help the world progress  
From small tasks to large projects  
Programming can make a great success
