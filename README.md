### today's poem  
  
Programming, the art of crafting code  
To make a machine run, like a well-oiled road  
  
Writing the instructions, so precise and exact  
The logic and syntax, the results will impact  
  
Lines of code for functions that can be called  
Data types to store, with each loop installed  
  
Conditional logic and branching, to determine the flow  
The logic dictates, the results will show  
  
Debugging and troubleshooting, to find the bug  
Testing to ensure, all is snug  
  
The end result is, a machine that's alive  
A program that functions, so that you can survive!
