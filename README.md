### today's poem  
  
Programming is my friend so true  
A powerful tool I use to do  
Writing code is a pleasure for sure  
The challenges I love to explore  
  
Debugging is the part I hate  
But still I persist and I wait  
For a solution to come my way  
To solve the problems of the day  
  
Programming has opened doors  
To new and exciting shores  
Exploring the world of tech  
I could never have reached  
  
Programming is a world of its own  
Where you can create and hone  
Your skills and knowledge you gain  
Will help you achieve your aim  
  
So when you learn a little coding  
A world of adventure awaits you  
Youâ€™ll find a path and forge ahead  
Programming will be your friend.
