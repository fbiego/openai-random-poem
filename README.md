### today's poem  
  
Programming, so complex and opaque  
A language so hard to decode  
It takes a special kind of brain  
To understand its inner workings and gain  
  
A daunting task to learn this skill  
A journey that can seem uphill  
But with dedication and hard work  
You can make your code go berserk  
  
You can create a world of wonders  
Using code to make it come alive  
From a simple game to a complex system  
Programming makes it all come to life  
  
Let your imagination run free  
Create something that will set you apart  
Explore the possibilities of programming  
And show the world your coding smarts!
