### today's poem  
  
Programming,  
A language so grand,  
It can bring ideas to life,  
Without a single strand.  
  
It can make a website,  
An app or game,  
From a single line of code,  
We can all make the same.  
  
Programming can be difficult,  
And it does take time,  
But those who persist,  
Will see success,  
In life and in rhyme.  
  
Programming is the future,  
A skill that is here to stay,  
It can be used to create,  
Things we use every day.
