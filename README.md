### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle,  
A complicated jumble.  
It can be a challenge,  
But it can also be a joy.  
  
To assemble the pieces and make them mesh,  
Takes a special sort of finesse.  
You might feel overwhelmed,  
But you can tackle it nonetheless.  
  
It requires logic and precision,  
A certain kind of wit.  
It's a skill that takes practice,  
To get it just right.  
  
But when you see the results,  
It's a feeling of such delight!  
Programming can be hard,  
But it can also be so bright.
