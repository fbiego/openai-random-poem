### today's poem  
  
Programming is my passion,  
The code I write with satisfaction,  
To create something from nothing,  
Is a feeling I can't explain.  
  
I love to make things come alive,  
To take my ideas and drive,  
To challenge my logic and my skill,  
To create something unique and still.  
  
I learn the syntax and semantics,  
And how to write and debug them,  
But the best part of all,  
Is when it works as intended, and I just smile.  
  
Programming is my life,  
It is what I know best,  
It has taught me so much,  
And I will always give it my best.
