### today's poem  
  
Programming, such an intricate thing  
A web of logic, a heavy ring  
A language of lines, a complex code  
A way to control, like a heavy load  
  
It's a language of ones and of zeroes  
A way of life that no one knows  
It's a way to make things happen  
A way to make things that never end  
  
Programming is a creative art  
A way to make things right from the start  
A way to solve problems that can't be done  
A way to make things that are never done  
  
It's a way to make things run  
A way to make sure things are done  
It's a way to make things happen  
A way to make things that never end  
  
Programming is a challenge of the mind  
A way to make things that are hard to find  
A way to solve problems that can't be done  
A way to make things that are never done.
