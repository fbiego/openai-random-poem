### today's poem  
  
Programming is my life,  
It's the thing that I strive.  
It's like a game of chess,  
A challenge that I must address.  
  
I can make things from nothing,  
Create a world with coding.  
It's a science, an art,  
It's something I take part.  
  
Programming is the way,  
To make a program play.  
It's like a puzzle to solve,  
Making it look good with resolve.  
  
Programming is my passion,  
It's something I will never fashion.  
It's the thing that I love,  
And it will come from above.
