### today's poem  
  
I write a code so deep and true  
A language that is new yet ancient too  
  
My fingers move so fast they blur,  
Guiding me through the programming blur  
  
I'm finding my way through the maze of bits  
The ones and zeroes are my only wits  
  
The syntax and the logic I must know  
To create a program that will surely grow  
  
My design is simple yet elegant  
It solves the problem in a moment  
  
I'm proud of what I have accomplished  
My labor of love is now polished  
  
From the code I've written I can see  
Infinite possibilities for all to be.
