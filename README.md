### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language of code  
A way to create with simple mode  
It helps us build websites and apps  
And gives us control of our tech traps  
  
It can be used to make a game  
A user interface that’s really the same  
It can create puzzles and other fun  
To keep us engaged in the sun  
  
It can be used to create a program  
That helps us stay on top of the scam  
It can help with data analysis  
And give us a better understanding of what we see  
  
Programming provides a way to think  
A way to keep our minds in sync  
It’s a language that’s ever changing  
A way to keep our lives rearranging
