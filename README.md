### today's poem  
  
Programming, a most curious thing  
It's a language that few can sing  
Though it often seems so complex  
It's the language of computers, no less  
  
It's the language of algorithms  
Of data structures and logic norms  
It's the language of machines  
And all their inner scenes  
  
Programming, a most curious thing  
It's a language that few can sing  
But for those that take the time to learn  
A world of wonders they will discern
