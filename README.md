### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a game,  
That you can play to ease your brain.  
It's a way to solve complex problems,  
And make a computer do what you want it to.  
  
It's like a puzzle that you design,  
A code so intricate and fine.  
You can make a program for any need,  
And have it run with perfect speed.  
  
It's a skill that requires a lot of learning,  
But it can be quite rewarding.  
You can make a website or a mobile app,  
And solve problems with a snap.  
  
Programming is not easy to master,  
But its rewards can last forever.  
It's a challenging and rewarding task,  
That will make you work harder and faster.
