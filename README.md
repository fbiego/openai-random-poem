### today's poem  
  
Programming is such a complex thing,  
Languages you must learn, and commands you must bring.  
From loops to functions, a lot of work you must do,  
But the rewards are worth it, don't think it untrue.  
  
Debugging and testing, it's all part of the game,  
But in the end you will feel so much fame.  
Designing and coding, a complex art,  
It's a skill you must learn, right from the start.  
  
Creating structures and objects, so much to keep in mind,  
But it's worth it when you find the right kind.  
Variables and classes have a lot of rules,  
But when you master them, you will look so cool.  
  
Programming is a challenge, but it's worth its weight in gold,  
It's a skill that you can use, as you grow old.  
It's a skill you must learn, if you want to be complete,  
And if you work hard, you'll be a master in no time, guaranteed.
