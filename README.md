### today's poem  
  
Though it can be tough,  
Programming's quite enough,  
If you think it's too rough,  
It's time to get tough.  
  
It can be quite daunting,  
But it's just like recanting,  
You must make sure you're wanting,  
To learn what you're recanting.  
  
It can seem overwhelming,  
But it's worth the telling,  
A skill that is excelling,  
In the world that keeps swelling.  
  
It's a task that's quite complex,  
But it's something to flex,  
You just have to keep checking,  
The steps you expect.  
  
You must use some logic,  
And never be dogmatic,  
You must stay quite robotic,  
And never be erratic.  
  
You must keep it precise,  
And never be surmise,  
You must keep in your sights,  
The end goal of all your strife.  
  
It's a skill worth having,  
And one that's worth savoring,  
But you must keep on striving,  
If you want to keep coding.
