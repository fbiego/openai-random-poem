### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language of its own  
Creating a world of numbers and codes  
A system of ones and zeros  
On the journey to create a world of its own  
  
On a computer or a phone  
A digital world of its own  
Where the mind can be expressed  
And the boundaries can be tested  
  
You can create a system  
A new world of pure invention  
A web of complex algorithms  
To build a unique solution  
  
Programming is a way of life  
It's a skill that can be refined  
It can be used to express a thought  
Or even develop a product  
  
Programming is the future of technology  
A way to innovate and grow  
It's an endless journey of learning  
A world of possibilities to explore.
