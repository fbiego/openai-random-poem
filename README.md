### today's poem  
  
Code builds the world around us  
A world of colors and sound  
From the depths of our computers  
We are the ones to astound  
  
Webpages, applications, and games  
We craft with such precision  
Our skills make a difference  
In the lives of many a mission  
  
Our art is in the logic  
The structure and the syntax  
We write with a purpose  
Our code shall never relax  
  
We are the engineers  
The builders of the future  
We use our creative minds  
To make the world much more pure  
  
Programming is our passion  
It’s what we were born to do  
We’ll continue to build this world  
For me and for you.
