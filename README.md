### today's poem  
  
Programming is my passion,  
It’s a language of creation,  
A way to make my dreams come true,  
And build something brand new.  
  
I can craft an application,  
Or a website from my imagination,  
A game that I can share,  
That anyone can play with care.  
  
Programming is a way to express,  
To make something to impress,  
A way to show my coding skill,  
To create something that will thrill.  
  
It’s more than just a job,  
It’s a hobby, a career, a mob,  
It’s a skill that I can use,  
To make something that I choose.  
  
Programming is my passion,  
It’s a language of creation,  
A way to make my dreams come true,  
And build something brand new.
