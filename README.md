### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language of its own,  
A skill to be practiced and honed,  
A way to express creativity,  
A key to success in the tech industry.  
  
It can help you build a website,  
Or a game that's really quite neat,  
You can design a program to do your bidding,  
No matter the task, it won't stop your winning.  
  
It's a process of trial and error,  
Testing and debugging, every hour,  
But with dedication and patience in hand,  
You can master its complexities and command.  
  
Programming can bring joy and satisfaction,  
A way to make your dreams come to fruition,  
No matter the language, the possibilities are endless,  
It's your ticket to a bright and successful future.
