### today's poem  
  
Programming with its binary code,  
Is a language that I can't decode.  
To the language of computers, I'm a novice,  
But the journey is one I'm determined to follow.  
  
I'll start with the basics and work my way up,  
Filling my mind with knowledge and stuff.  
My goal is to become a master of the machines,  
To be able to make them do whatever it pleases.  
  
I'll study the syntax and understand the logic,  
I'm determined to work until I'm top-notch.  
I'll learn every language and each command,  
So I can create something that's hard to comprehend.  
  
I'll use the skills I learn to make something great,  
A program to do things no one can relate.  
It may take time but I'm willing to wait,  
To be the best programmer I can be is my fate.
