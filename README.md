### today's poem  
  
My computer is my canvas  
I dream of a world so grand  
A universe of code and logic  
Where I can take a stand  
  
A place where I can create  
A world that's just my own  
A place where I can innovate  
And leave a lasting tone  
  
I tinker with algorithms  
To solve complex math problems  
All the while I'm dreaming  
Of achieving great honours  
  
The debugging process can be hard  
But I persist until I'm done  
The result of my hard work  
Is a beautiful piece of code that's spun  
  
My creations can help others  
Solve their own problems too  
Bringing joy and satisfaction  
To all those who use  
  
This is why I love programming  
It's my passion in life  
A joy that I share with the world  
With every line of code I write.
