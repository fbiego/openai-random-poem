### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language  
so precise and so fine  
It's an art that can be mastered  
with practice and time  
  
It takes intelligence and skill  
to make a program run  
and a bit of creativity  
to make it fun  
  
It's a way to solve problems  
and create something new  
It's a challenge that is thrilling  
for me and you  
  
So let's keep learning  
from the masters of the craft  
and together we will make  
something that will last
