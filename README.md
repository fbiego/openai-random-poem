### today's poem  
  
A language of ones and zeros  
A language of ifs and thens  
Programming is a game  
To give life to your dreams  
  
A language of logic and lines  
A language of quirks and signs  
Programming is a gift  
To make things more precise  
  
A language of syntax and structure  
A language of bugs and fixes  
Programming is a tool  
To build things that are cool  
  
A language of order and meaning  
A language of algorithms and schemes  
Programming is an art  
To give life to your heart
