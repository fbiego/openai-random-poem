### today's poem  
  
Programming, so many rules,  
It can be a confusing tool.  
But when the code works just right,  
We get the feeling of pure delight.  
  
It's a language all its own:  
To understand, you must hone  
A set of skills and a sharp wit  
To make sure the program works just right.  
  
It takes logic and analysis,  
A knack for problem-solving,  
To bring a concept to life  
And create something that's worthwhile.  
  
Programming is the key:  
To unlock a world of opportunities  
That will help us make a mark  
And create a better future for us all.
