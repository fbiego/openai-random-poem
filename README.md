### today's poem  
  
Programming is a way to create,  
With lines of code we can innovate,  
From a simple game to a new website,  
Programming can make it all complete.  
  
We can make robots move and talk,  
We can make a powerful app that can walk,  
From a basic website to a complex software,  
Programming can make it all run with ease.  
  
We can build a game that can fly,  
Using code we can make it try,  
From a calculator to a search engine,  
Programming can make it all so keen.  
  
Programming can be a challenge,  
You'll need to use your knowledge,  
From a calculator to a chatbot,  
Programming can make it all hot.  
  
Programming can be difficult,  
But it can be so rewarding,  
From a game to a website,  
Programming can make it all complete.
