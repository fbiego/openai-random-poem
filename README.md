### today's poem  
  
Programming is the act of creating life  
From a computer's perspective, it is a strife  
A program is a set of instructions to take  
It's how a computer can learn and bake  
  
Programming is like a language to teach  
It's the language of the technology we reach  
A program is created with a purpose in mind  
And if done right, it can be quite a find  
  
Programming can be used for games  
As well as all kinds of other things  
It's used to make robots and websites too  
It's a science that we've come to pursue  
  
Programming can be a complex task  
But the rewards can be great, no need to ask  
It's an ever-changing skill to obtain  
A skill that will never become mundane.
