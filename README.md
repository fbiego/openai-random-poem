### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle,  
A challenge to solve.  
It takes creativity and skill,  
To make the code evolve.  
  
It can be tedious and hard,  
But also quite rewarding.  
It's a puzzle that teaches,  
And skills that will never be boring.  
  
At times, it may seem overwhelming,  
But stick with it and you'll see.  
The answers you seek,  
Will appear eventually.  
  
Programming is like a game,  
Where coding is the key.  
Each step of the way,  
You'll learn and grow, technically.  
  
So take the challenge and don't be afraid,  
And soon you'll be coding like a pro.  
Your skills will be sharp,  
And you'll be ready to go!
