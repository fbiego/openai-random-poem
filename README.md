### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle,  
A challenge that I must solve.  
It's a game of logic and skill,  
A game I can't dissolve.  
  
My mind is set in motion  
As I try to figure out  
What command should go where  
And which ones can I leave out.  
  
I'm full of ideas  
But code is what I need.  
I'll work until I'm done  
And I'll be sure to succeed.  
  
My work is built with patience  
To make it just right.  
It's an art of my own making  
A masterpiece of my own design.  
  
The hours I put in  
Are many and long.  
But the end result is worth it,  
A program that plays a song.  
  
Programming is a passion,  
A task that I must do.  
It's a skill I want to master  
And a challenge I will pursue.
