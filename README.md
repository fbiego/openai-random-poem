### today's poem  
  
Programming is a wondrous thing  
It can do so many things  
Creating new software, applications, and games  
It's all done with code and a few strings  
  
From a computer to a phone  
Programming can make it all known  
From a website to a store  
Programming can open any door  
  
A compiler, an interpreter, a debugger, too  
Programming can help you get through  
A language like Java, C#, or Python  
Programming can make your dreams come true  
  
Programming takes hard work and dedication  
But the end result is worth all its dedication  
Software, websites, and more  
Programming will open any door
