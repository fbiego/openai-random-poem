### today's poem  
  
Coding can be hard at times,  
  
But it's worth the effort and the grind,  
  
When you get it right, it's a beautiful sight,  
  
The thrill of accomplishment is divine.  
  
You'll make mistakes and get confused,  
  
But don't let it make you lose your muse,  
  
Always keep your head up,  
  
And keep on coding your stuff.  
  
Achievements will come with time,  
  
For the hard work you put in,  
  
You'll learn skills and be able to find,  
  
New ways to solve problems within.  
  
Programming is a great pursuit,  
  
It will give you a sense of accomplishment and repute,  
  
Always remember to enjoy the ride,  
  
And the rewards will come with tide.
