### today's poem  
  
Programming, a world of its own,  
Where logic and design can be shown,  
To make a machine do as you please,  
You must learn the secrets of the keys.  
  
Using algorithms to create a task,  
The code must be written to outlast,  
From Java to Python, no language is left,  
Creating a program to conquer and heft.  
  
Debugging errors and making it right,  
Testing the output to make sure it's tight,  
Programming is the way to go,  
It's a world of its own, you'll know.
