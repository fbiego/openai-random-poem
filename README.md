### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle,  
Each piece you must assemble.  
Finding each missing part,  
To make your program stable.  
  
You must debug your codes,  
Until the computer nods.  
Writing each line with care,  
To make sure your program runs fair.  
  
You must learn the syntax,  
For your code to compile.  
Testing and debugging,  
To make sure it runs mile.  
  
Programming is no simple task,  
But with practice and time,  
Your code will work,  
And you'll be sublime!
