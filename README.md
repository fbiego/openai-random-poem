### today's poem  
  
My skill is creative,  
A craft of the digital age,  
Programming, to me,  
Is a language I can engage.  
  
A code of syntax and logic,  
To make computers do my will.  
A problem to solve or game to play,  
My mind is set to thrill.  
  
Hours I commit to this path,  
Developing apps with glee.  
A puzzle to solve or program to write,  
My passion I can see.  
  
From scratch to the end product,  
My work is truly a feat.  
To create something of value,  
It's a feeling of great heat.  
  
The challenge of the task,  
Is what brings me joy.  
Programming is my passion,  
My skill I will employ.
