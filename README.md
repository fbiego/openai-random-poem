### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle  
A challenge that I must solve  
I must tinker and fiddle  
To see what I can absolve  
  
My thoughts I translate to code  
My logic I must refine  
I look for the solutions  
That fit the problem in line  
  
My fingers fly across the keyboard  
My eyes glued to the screen

My program has been completed  
My code ran without hitch  
I smile and feel proud of my work  
As I sit satisfied with a twitch
