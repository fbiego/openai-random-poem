### today's poem  
  
The code is my plaything  
I revel in the challenge  
It's pure logic and function  
in which I can delve and delve  
  
I can make it do what I want  
control and shape the outcome  
with a few simple commands  
or a few lines of a script  
  
Computer programs are my canvas  
on which I can paint my dreams  
and bring my ideas to life  
with a few clicks of keys  
  
It's a puzzle to be solved  
the logic must be right  
but when the pieces all fit together  
the output can be quite a sight  
  
Programming is my craft  
I excel at the art  
it's a journey of discovery  
and a work of the heart
