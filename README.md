### today's poem  
  
Programming, oh Programming,  
Your puzzles keep me thinking  
Patience and precision make it  
A challenge worth pursuing  
  
Computer code and algorithms  
Abstract logic I must learn  
To create a program that works  
My code must always churn  
  
Debugging is a challenge too  
To find errors I must root  
It can be a tedious task  
But it's a skill I must pursue  
  
Programming, oh Programming  
At times I'm so frustrated  
But with hard work and dedication  
My skills will be cultivated
