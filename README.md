### today's poem  
  
Programming is a secret language,  
A way to unlock a world unseen.  
A way to make a computer work  
With commands that no one's ever seen.  
  
It's a way to make a program  
To do whatever you want it to do.  
It's a way to make a program  
Run faster, better, and true.  
  
Programming is a creative way  
To see a problem through.  
Sometimes it's a challenge  
That can seem impossible to you.  
  
But if you take the time and dedication  
You'll find a way to make a program do  
Whatever it is you want it to do  
And make the impossible come true.
