### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language that I know  
A set of instructions that I must show  
A way to tell a computer what to do  
A way to make the world brand new  
  
Programming is a skill that I must learn  
A way to make my ideas turn  
From a thought in my head to an action in code  
Making new things no one has ever showed  
  
Programming is a challenge that I love  
A way to make what I'm thinking of  
A way to make things from nothing at all  
A way to make life better for us all  
  
Programming is a journey I take  
A way to create and never break  
A way to make things work and play  
A way to make the world a better place today
