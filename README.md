### today's poem  
  
Programming oh so glorious,  
This world of code and syntax,  
A universe of numbers and letters,  
A language so complex.  
  
A challenge for all to master,  
A skill to be honed,  
A way to create something new,  
In ways never before known.  
  
There are bugs and glitches,  
And endless debugging,  
But with patience and practice,  
The answers can be found.  
  
Programming is a skill,  
That takes time,  
But when you finally do,  
You'll be able to design.  
  
So many possibilities,  
For what you can build,  
It's an exciting way,  
To express your creativity.  
  
Programming oh so glorious,  
This world of code and syntax,  
A universe of numbers and letters,  
A language so complex.
