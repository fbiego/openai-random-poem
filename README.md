### poem  
  
A programming life I lead,  
A world of endless possibilities,  
A skill I've come to need.  
  
My tools are of the digital type,  
My hands are always on the keys,  
My work can be of any stripe.  
  
I write the code, I test the builds,  
At times I'm stuck and can't move on,  
But soon I find the way to fill the fields.  
  
My thoughts flow like a raging river,  
My ideas are sharp and bright,  
My work is ever-changing, ever-growing, ever-shifting.  
  
My mind is a complex machine,  
My code is my creation,  
My work is my own unique expression.  
  
I work out the bugs and problems,  
I write the code to solve them,  
My work is a challenge, but also a source of pride.  
  
My programming life, it's always changing,  
The challenges I face, I'm never done,  
But I'm still learning and growing, and that's what's so fun.
