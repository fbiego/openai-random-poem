### today's poem  
  
Programming, my closest friend  
Makes me feel like I can transcend   
Debugging and troubleshooting, the fun never ends   
Never a dull moment, no need to pretend  
  
Creating algorithms, in an orderly fashion   
Coding in Python, an amazing sensation   
Learning new libraries, a great education   
Finding solutions, an amazing sensation  
  
Coding games, the hours fly   
Making websites, from the sky  
Designing databases, no need to cry   
Making programs, makes me high  
  
Programming's a skill, that's here to stay   
It's taught in schools, in every way  
It's made me more creative, it's here to stay   
Programming's my passion, every single day
