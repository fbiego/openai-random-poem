### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a jigsaw puzzle,  
It's a complex game that has its own rules.  
  
It's a game of logic and of thought,  
It's filled with both challenge and naught.  
  
In programming there's no right or wrong,  
It's a complex puzzle that can take long.  
  
It's a game of problem-solving and of flow,  
It's a game of debugging and of trial and error, oh.  
  
It's a game of debugging and of trial and error, oh.  
It's a game of coding and of finding the right path.  
  
It's a game of trial and error,  
It's a game of finding a solution to the problem at hand.  
  
It's a game of logic and of thought,  
It's a game of coding and of debugging and trial and error.  
  
It's a game of fun and frustration,  
But when you get it, it's a great satisfaction!
