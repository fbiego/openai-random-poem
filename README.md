### today's poem  
  
Programming, to me, is a way of life  
A way to create something new from nothing but strife  
  
From a blank canvas to a masterpiece  
Every line of code a chance to release  
  
The power to make anything you can think  
A new world of ideas, if you just take a blink  
  
From a web page to an app  
Programming can make it all snap  
  
So if you want to build something grand  
Start programming and take a stand  
  
A language of ones and zeros  
A way to make your dreams come true, that's for sure  
  
Programming is a skill that is worth its weight in gold  
A way to make your mark, so don't be too bold  
  
For those who want to be creative and explore  
Programming is the key to the digital door
