### today's poem  
  
Programming, a language of logic  
A way to express our thoughts  
No matter what the task may be  
We all can learn and grow  
  
Sometimes it can be a challenge  
To understand the syntax  
But if we keep plugging away  
We'll make our code complex  
  
We can make our computer do  
Whatever we choose to do  
We can build a game or website  
The possibilities are quite a few  
  
Programming, a language of logic  
A way to express our thoughts  
No matter how hard it may be  
We can all learn and grow
