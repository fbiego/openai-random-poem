### today's poem  
  
Computers are my closest friend,  
My programming skills never end.  
I can create a program with ease,  
To solve a problem or just to please.  
  
I can build a website or game,  
It's like a puzzle I can tame.  
My creativity will never cease,  
I'm coding with a perfect peace.  
  
I can solve complex problems too,  
From endless lines of code I will view.  
I can debug and make it work,  
My programming skills I will never shirk.  
  
My programs will serve people well,  
For any issues I will not yell.  
I love to see when the code works,  
My programming skill will never jerk.
