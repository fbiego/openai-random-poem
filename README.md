### today's poem  
  
Programming, a language unknown  
A task that appears not to be fun  
A code and a syntax in every line  
To create something new, so sublime  
  
Computers are complex, and not too kind  
Sometimes their response is hard to find  
Debugging, it seems, is the only way  
To make sure the code runs, without delay  
  
Programming has a certain appeal  
Creating something that you can feel  
A game, a website, or maybe an app  
It's all possible with a few lines of code, that's a fact  
  
Programming is something that I love  
It's a challenge and a blessing from above  
It's a challenge that I'm happy to take  
A language that I'll never forsake
