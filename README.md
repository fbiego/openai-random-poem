### today's poem  
  
At the keyboard I'm typing away,  
I'm a coder, here to stay,  
A problem is what I'm trying to crack,  
The syntax I must get just right,  
Till my code will run and take flight.  
  
My algorithm I must perfect,  
Else my program will be inept,  
A bug is lurking, I must find it soon,  
Else the program will not run,  
My debugging skills I must hone.  
  
I'm learning more everyday,  
My programming skills will stay,  
My code will run like a dream,  
It will be the best that it can be,  
A coder's success is what I'm striving to be.
