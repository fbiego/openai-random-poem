### today's poem  
  
Programming's a skill I'm trying to learn,  
It's on my list of things to discern.  
Not only have I got to think hard,  
But also keep track of every card.  
  
For each and every line of code,  
There's a logic that I must decode.  
It's a challenge for my brain to find,  
The answer that I need to bind.  
  
I'm still getting used to the syntax,  
And trying not to use too many hex.  
But with each new bit of knowledge I acquire,  
My skills of programming grow so much higher.  
  
Programming is a language all its own,  
It's a way to make even the abstractly known.  
For those who take the time to learn,  
A world of possibilities will then begin to turn.
