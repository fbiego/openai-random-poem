### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language,  
A way of speaking without words,  
A way to create an image  
That can be seen and heard.  
  
Programming is a science,  
A way of understanding,  
A way to make the impossible  
Seem like a simple thing.  
  
Programming is an art,  
A way of seeing the world,  
A way to give life to ideas  
That would otherwise remain unfurled.  
  
Programming is a puzzle,  
A way of solving problems,  
A way to give a voice  
To those without one who are doomed.  
  
Programming is a power,  
A way of changing the world,  
A way to make a difference  
And open up a new world.
