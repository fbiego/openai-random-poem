### today's poem  
  
Programming's like a puzzle,  
It's a challenge that can drive you insane.  
But when you break it down,  
You can create something great and maintain.  
  
It's a language that's precise,  
And commands must be so exact.  
But when it's all done right,  
A masterpiece is what you'll exact.  
  
It can be as simple or as complex,  
As you want it to be.  
But no matter the difficulty,  
It's a great tool to see.  
  
Programming can be tedious,  
But it can be quite rewarding.  
It can be used to do great things,  
And can be quite astounding.  
  
So take a deep breath and dive in,  
And tackle this programming task.  
You'll find success and satisfaction,  
When you complete your programming task.
