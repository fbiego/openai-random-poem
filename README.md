### today's poem  
  
Programming is a tool for all,  
It can help you when you stall,  
A means to create and build,  
Helping you to learn and fill.  
  
It's a language of the tech savvy,  
A way to make things savvy,  
Using coding to make a game,  
Or a website with no shame.  
  
The possibilities are endless,  
A way to make things pleasant,  
Computer science and software,  
So many things to explore.  
  
The challenge of debugging,  
To find out what's occurring,  
Programming can be tough,  
But it's always worth the effort.  
  
A skill to get ahead,  
Tackling problems to be fed,  
Programming is a great way,  
To make something out of nothing today.
