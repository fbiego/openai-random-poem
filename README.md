### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language of the future  
A way to make computers do your bidding  
It can be hard to learn, but it's so rewarding  
You can build things you never thought you could do  
  
A world of possibilities awaits  
Complex algorithms and intricate states  
The machines you create and the stories you tell  
Are all thanks to this magical spell  
  
You can build games, apps, or websites  
You can work on mobile or desktop devices  
You can learn the basics and then go further  
And create things that have never been done before  
  
Programming is a skill that will always be useful  
You can make money or build something beautiful  
It's an ever-changing field with so much to explore  
And it's a great way to open more doors
