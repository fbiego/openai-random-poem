### poem  
  
A language of ones and zeroes,  
A language of abstraction.  
Loops and functions,  
Variables and strings.  
  
The power of a computer,  
To reshape the world.  
A language to unlock,  
A universe of possibilities.  
  
An enigma of logic,  
A process of trial and error.  
Debugging and testing,  
Statements and algorithms.  
  
The beauty of programming,  
The creativity of thought.  
Solving problems with precision,  
And building something from nothing.  
  
A complex world of coding,  
A place for innovation.  
A language of power and control,  
The language of programming.
