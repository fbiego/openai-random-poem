### today's poem  
  
Programming is like an art,  
It's like a language that we must impart.  
A skill that's so important in today's age,  
It's become a force no one can assuage.  
  
A way of thinking, a way of seeing,  
A way of solving all of our needs.  
A way of making, a way of breaking,  
A way of doing, without any forsaking.  
  
It's a way of life, of finding the right code,  
A way of learning, of being bold.  
A way of creating, of being innovative,  
A way of being, of being creative.  
  
In the end, programming's a journey,  
A path that's full of twists and turns.  
It's a process of learning, of playing and exploring,  
And of using our minds to keep growing.
