### today's poem  
  
Programming's a science so unique,  
A language with its own technique.  
A type of math that's so complex,  
That all around the world it's checked.  
  
From the code you can create,  
A program that cannot be beat.  
A game that has no end in sight,  
A website that looks just right.  
  
Programming's a skill so sublime,  
It's how we make computers chime.  
From a few lines of code so deep,  
We can make computers so cheap.  
  
Programming's a gift we have,  
To make the world a better place.  
From developing a new app,  
To coding a website that's sharp.  
  
Programming's a way to express,  
A new language, no less.  
A skill we should always improve,  
For our future to always move.
