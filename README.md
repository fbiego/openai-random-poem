### today's poem  
  
A computer's heart throbs with the beat of a drum  
As the programmer sets it in motion, one by one  
The instructions, the codes, the logic unfold  
To make the machine here do what it's told  
  
The syntax and structure, the commands all in place  
The programmer solves the problem with finesse and grace  
A line of code here, a variable there  
The system works seamlessly without a care  
  
The logic and algorithms, chains of commands  
The programmer's brain works with such demands  
The program runs with zest and power  
The programmer's skill will never cower  
  
The algorithms, the codes, the system that runs  
The programmer with his skill makes it all come undone  
As the programmer writes the code that binds  
He makes the computer do just what he has designed.
