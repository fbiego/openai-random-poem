### today's poem  
  
Programming, so complex and deep,  
From the simple to the very steep.  
Creating a program that's sound and true,  
Coding with bits and bytes anew.  
  
Designing a program with skill and care,  
Lines of code compiled everywhere.  
Debugging, testing, to get it right,  
Executing commands with all your might.  
  
Chasing after bugs late at night,  
Logic and debugging in full flight.  
Searching the code to find the clues,  
Debugging the program to make it choose.  
  
Data Structures and algorithms,  
A challenge for the most of us.  
Finding the best way for its use,  
Programming can be so much fun and reuse.  
  
The complexity of coding is no joke,  
It takes skill and time to make it work.  
So take your time and do your best,  
And soon you'll have a program that passes the test.
