### today's poem  
  
Algorithms in motion,  
Coding with precision,  
A language of logic,  
That answers all questions.  
  
Creating commands,  
To make a machine understand,  
A complex system,  
Where clarity can expand.  
  
From algorithms to objects,  
The language never stops,  
Exploring options,  
Until the code pops.  
  
Debugging syntax,  
Making sure it all makes sense,  
A puzzle of patterns,  
For an effective defense.  
  
Programming is a puzzle,  
Where the pieces all work together,  
A challenge of the mind,  
That creates a creative endeavor.
