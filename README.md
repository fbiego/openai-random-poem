### today's poem  
  
Programming, it's a joyous thing  
A language that's made of zeroes and ones  
It can be used to create everything   
From a website to a game  
  
It's a tool that can make our lives easier  
It can be used to automate tasks  
It can help us find answers that are quicker  
And solve problems with just a few clicks  
  
It's a skill that's in high demand  
That can help you make a good living  
It can be used to build things that no one has seen  
Give you a great sense of giving  
  
It's an art that requires patience and some brains  
It's a skill that'll help you succeed  
It's a language that'll never go away  
Programming, it's a beautiful thing indeed.
