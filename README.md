### today's poem  
  
Programming is more than just a craft  
It's a skill that will never be lost  
It's a way to create and build  
From a language that's not quite so bold  
  
A language made of ones and zeroes  
A way to make things come alive  
To create a world of code and logic  
Where anything can survive  
  
A way to be creative and free  
To make something that's never been seen  
It's a way to express yourself  
In a language so very keen  
  
Programming is a way of life  
A way to learn and grow  
To create something with your own hands  
It's a skill that you should know
