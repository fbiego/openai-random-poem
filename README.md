### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle  
That you must solve  
To get the output you need  
You must think and evolve  
  
It takes a lot of thought  
And a bit of time  
To get it right  
And finally make it sublime  
  
Your mind needs to be sharp  
And your skills must be honed  
For the variables and codes  
Must be correctly shown  
  
When you’ve cracked the code  
You’ll feel a rush of pride  
For the answer you’ve found  
Gives a sense of stride  
  
Programming is a challenge  
That you must take on  
But when you get the output  
You’ll know it was worth it all along
