### today's poem  
  
A world of ones and zeroes,   
A place of logic and code   
Where the lines of thought run deep   
Where creativity can unload   
  
A place of structure and order   
Where the code is never wrong   
Where the solutions can be found   
If you can think it, you can song   
  
In a language that’s precise   
A code that’s written clear   
A world of programming  
Where technology can hear   
  
A craft that’s ever-changing   
A skill that’s mastered with ease   
A world of programming   
Where the possibilities never cease
