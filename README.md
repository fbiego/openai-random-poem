### today's poem  
  
A machine of code and logic,  
  
A language that's complex and wide;  
A way to make computers think,  
A program that's so refined.  
  
A maze of systems and algorithms,  
A mind that's so precise;  
A programmer's guide to the world,  
And a way to make things nice.  
  
A way to solve a problem,  
A tool to make something cool;  
A way to help the world progress,  
And to make things that are new.  
  
It takes patience, skill and practice,  
To make something so sublime;  
A programmer's art, of coding and more,  
Is a passion that's hard to define.
