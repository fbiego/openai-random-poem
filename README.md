### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language  
To make the machines obey  
It's logic and structure  
To make the world our way  
  
We create the solutions  
To complex problems that we face  
We use our knowledge and skill  
To make a better place  
  
We craft the applications  
That run on computers and phones  
We write the code that powers  
The websites and the drones  
  
We write the algorithms  
That control the robots at work  
We design the software  
That makes the systems work  
  
Programming is a language  
That allows us to dream  
We use it to solve problems  
And make technology seem  
  
We create the future  
By writing code that's right  
Programming is our language  
Let's use it to take flight.
