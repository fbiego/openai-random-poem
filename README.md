### today's poem  
  
Like a puzzle to solve  
Programming I love  
It's a challenge I crave  
A logic exercise  
  
A new idea to conceive  
My creativity's stirred  
By the power I receive  
  
My brain's in a whirl  
As I write my codes  
Debugging my program  
To make sure it flows  
  
My aim as I work  
Is to create something new  
A one-of-a-kind program  
That's sure to wow the few  
  
Passionate and driven  
By this task I'm engaged  
I'm ready to conquer  
My programming saga!
