### today's poem  
  
I write in code, all day long  
A language of ones and zeroes strong  
I can solve complex problems, it's true  
And make computers do things, just for you  
  
My code is precise, and it works just fine  
It's my way of expressing, my thoughts and my mind  
Each line is crafted, with purpose and care  
To produce a program that people can share  
  
I'm a programmer, it's what I do  
Creating applications, and tinkering too  
No matter how hard, I never give up  
I'm determined to fix, whatever bugs I've messed up  
  
I'm proud to be a programmer you see  
It's my way of changing the world, and making it better for me
