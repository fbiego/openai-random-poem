### today's poem  
  
A world of logic and of code  
A computer's power to be explored  
A programmer's mind to think and to probe  
And a language to be honed  
  
A program that can perform a task  
A set of instructions to pass  
A system of rules to process and ask  
And a program to be shown  
  
The language of computers is complex  
It's often a challenge to express  
But when the code is written with finesse  
The result can be quite impressive  
  
A program to define a process  
A way to solve a problem with success  
A way to make a computer confess  
A language to be mastered  
  
A programmer is a coder of dreams  
A master of the language of machines  
A wizard of code and of streams  
Programming is an art
