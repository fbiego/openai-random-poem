### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a puzzle  
A challenge that's full of hustle  
A challenge of wit and patience  
A challenge of logic and science  
  
It's a combination of bits and bytes  
A combination of ones and zeroes  
A combination of building and problem solving  
A combination of looking and doing  
  
It's a language of math and logic  
A language of instructions and syntax  
A language of algorithms and abstractions  
A language of data and operations  
  
It's a way of thinking and solving  
A way of understanding and creating  
A way of being creative and innovative  
A way of expressing and communicating  
  
Programming is what I do  
To make my ideas come true  
To make my dreams and visions real  
To make my computer do my will
