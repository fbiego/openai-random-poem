### today's poem  
  
Programming, the art of code  
To tell the computer what to do  
It's a language of ones and zeros  
That can bring a machine to life, too  
  
Whether from scratch or from a template  
A program will follow your lead  
It's a jumble of symbols and logic  
That can make a computer succeed  
  
It's a craft that takes time and patience  
And often requires a new way of thinking  
But the rewards are great in the end  
When you see your program running  
  
Programming is a complex endeavor  
But with practice comes understanding  
The more you learn, the more you can do  
To make your program even more demanding
