### today's poem  
  
Programming is my life's true passion  
The ability to create and be a fashion  
A craft so vast, so many facets  
From computer science to web designs, you bet  
  
I love the challenge of problem solving  
Finding the right code to keep evolving  
Writing a script or debugging a program  
No matter the task, I'm sure to cram  
  
The joy that comes when the code is done  
The satisfaction of a job well done  
The thrill of being able to create  
It's enough to make me levitate  
  
My journey to programming I'm ever-learning  
A life skill that's always yearning  
My code is my own, truly unique  
And my passion for this craft will never be meek
