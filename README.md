### today's poem  
  
A language of ones and zeroes,  
Programming is a clever art,  
That allows us to create code,  
To make things with a logical start.  
  
We can make computers be smart,  
Using a skill that's quite rare,  
It's a way to make machines work,  
Creating software with care.  
  
We can code, solve, and debug,  
To create programs that will last,  
Making something from nothing,  
That can help us go much faster.  
  
Programming can do the impossible,  
Using lines of code so true,  
It's an art that's ever changing,  
And something that will always renew.
