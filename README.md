### today's poem  
  
Programming is a form of art  
A way to express in a new start  
It takes time and dedication  
But with it, a world of creation  
  
The possibilities are endless  
From apps to websites, you can impress  
From the low level to the high  
With just a few lines, you can fly  
  
Your ideas will come to life  
Your projects will be rife  
With a bit of knowledge and skill  
You can make something that's quite a thrill  
  
Programming is a great skill  
It will help you climb the hill  
So grab a keyboard and start coding  
And your world will soon be exploding!
