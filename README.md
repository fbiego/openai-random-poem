### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a craft  
Creating something from nothing  
You start with a blank slate  
And craft a masterpiece  
  
It's a creative outlet  
A challenge to the mind  
Coding has no limit  
You can create almost anything  
  
It's a language of its own  
A way to make the world a better place  
Developing solutions to problems  
Creating something of substance  
  
Programming can be daunting  
It takes great skill and knowledge  
But the rewards are immense  
A world of possibilities await
