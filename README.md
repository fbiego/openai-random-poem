### today's poem  
  
Programming is my passion,  
My life is all about code,  
It runs through my veins  
Like a river on a road.  
  
It's my source of income,  
My career and my fame,  
Programming is my ticket  
To a life full of gain.  
  
It's a puzzle I can solve,  
A game I can play,  
Where every turn and twist  
Helps me to find my way.  
  
It's a language to learn,  
A skill to be mastered,  
Programming is a challenge  
That I'm never to be out-blasted.  
  
It's a way to express,  
My creativity and thought,  
Programming is my passion  
My code will never be bought.
