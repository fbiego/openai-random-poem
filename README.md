### today's poem  
  
Programming is my passion  
I sit and I type with elation  
Coding and creating, day and night  
Testing and debugging, with all my might  
  
Lines of code, I love to write  
Sometimes I stay up all night  
Making sure my programs work just right  
Achieving success, a sense of delight  
  
Debugging, I do with ease  
All my programs, I will please  
No errors, no bugs, nothing to impede  
I'm confident, I have all I need  
  
Programming is my craft  
I'm proud of the things I have made  
Computers and I, we make a great pair  
With coding, I will always be there
