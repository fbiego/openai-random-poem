### today's poem  
  
Programming, it’s a language that’s so grand  
From the mundane to the complex, it’s at hand  
It’s the language of machines, a bridge between man  
A key to unlocking the future, and the past  
  
Lines of code that stream on like a river  
Syntax that’s precise, it’s so clever  
It’s the language of the web, more powerful than ever  
A must for any tech enthusiast, it’s a must-have  
  
It’s a creative outlet, a way to express  
A way to make something out of nothing, I must confess  
It’s a way to make things happen, and to progress  
It’s a way to bring ideas to life, it’s the best  
  
Programming, it’s a language that never ends  
A way to make the world a better place, and to transcend  
It’s the language of the future, it’s the language of trends  
It’s a language I can’t get enough of, so I’ll never stop learning.
