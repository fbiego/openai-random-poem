### today's poem  
  
Programming so precise, so exact  
A language of machines, with nary a quack  
Able to create programs of all shapes and sizes  
From the tiniest apps to the most sophisticated sites  
  
From business to science, from games to finance  
Programming can do it with skill and finesse  
It's a language of computers, an art of its own  
Where a few lines of code can make a world of its own  
  
Where logic and reason can bring forth great solutions  
Where creativity and math can create revolutions  
Programming is a language that can take us far  
And can make our dreams come true, near or far  
  
Programming's power can make us soar  
Bringing forth advances to the world and more  
It's a language of computers that can shape our future  
And make a better world, even better and surer
