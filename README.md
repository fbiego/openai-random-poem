### today's poem  
  
Programming, what can I say?  
It’s a world of complexities at play  
Where creativity and logic intertwine  
And solutions are found with time  
  
A seemingly endless journey of learning  
In a language that can be quite concerning  
The hours spent debugging, an exercise in patience  
But a great reward when the job is complete  
  
A way to turn ideas into reality  
As a programmer, you have the ability  
To create something that's so unique  
That it can make the world go weak  
  
So if you want to create something grand  
Programming is the place to land  
It’s a challenge, but so worth it in the end  
To create something that stands out from the rest.
