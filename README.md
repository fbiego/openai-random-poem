### poem  
  
With patience and focus I can program,  
My creation will bring me joy and acclaim.  
I'll be precise and I'll be methodical,  
My code will be precise and logical.  
  
I'll structure my code, I'll make a plan,  
My variables will be in order, neat and spanned.  
I'll make sure my syntax is right and precise,  
My painstaking effort will be well-advised.  
  
My loops will be flawless and my if statements neat,  
The function calls will execute with a feat.  
My code will be written with great care and thought,  
My program's success I'll never have to be bought.  
  
My program will shine, it will succeed and soar,  
My code will be efficient, fast and more.  
My code will be read and people will see,  
My programming prowess for all to be.
