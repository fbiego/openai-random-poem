### today's poem  
  
Programming is my passion, it’s my obsession  
The thrill of creating something that’s my own expression  
There’s nothing quite like it, it’s the ultimate high  
It’s something that I can’t wait to try  
  
From the comfort of my chair I can work on a line of code  
And make something useful that I can proudly show  
A few clicks and I can make a change  
That’s why I’m so passionate about coding and my range  
  
It’s not just about the technical stuff  
It’s also about problem solving and being tough  
Finding solutions to everyday problems  
That’s where the real challenge lies, it’s true  
  
I love the satisfaction of seeing my work work  
It’s so fulfilling when I see the results  
It’s moments like these that make coding so great  
And why I’ll always enjoy programming to this day.
