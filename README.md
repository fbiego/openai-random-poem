### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language of the future,  
Where computers and humans interact,  
A craft of complex and intricate structure,  
To build a world of digital fact.  
  
It's a way to communicate with machines,  
To make them do what we desire,  
To control what they do and how they act,  
A language we must all acquire.  
  
It's a skill that allows us to make dreams come true,  
To build a world that never ends,  
To create something from nothing at all,  
That's the beauty of programming friends.  
  
So let us embrace the power of code,  
A language that can be understood,  
Let us learn the art of programming,  
And use it to better our world.
