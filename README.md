### today's poem  
  
Programming is a skill that I must learn  
To help me create the things I yearn  
  
It takes patience and practice and thought  
To achieve the goals I have sought  
  
I will break problems down into small chunks  
To figure out how to make them work  
  
I will use loops to go through data  
To make sure everything is up to date  
  
I will use conditionals to direct the flow  
To get to the results that I will know  
  
I will use functions to group code  
To make it easier to debug and load  
  
I will use classes to structure the code  
To make it easier to manage and code  
  
My knowledge of programming will grow  
As I continue to learn and explore  
  
Building applications and websites too  
Will be part of the things I do  
  
Programming is a skill I have learned  
It has given me knowledge that I have earned
