### today's poem  
  
Programming is the future of the world  
It gives us the power to make it all unfurl  
We can create anything with a few simple lines  
From a website to a game that will blow your mind  
  
You can learn the language and create something new  
It's easier than it seems, just give it a try or two  
We can learn how to build something that will last  
And we'll find the solutions to our problems in the past  
  
Programming can take us to a place we've never seen  
It can show us the beauty of a code that's so pristine  
We can create a world of our own design  
Where we can explore and learn and truly shine  
  
Programming is a language for everyone  
It's the language of the future, it's here to be done  
We can learn how to write code and make it our own  
And create a world that will never be shown
