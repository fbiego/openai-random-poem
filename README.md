### today's poem  
  
A language of logic and code,  
That creates an algorithm of hope  
The computer responds in robotic way  
A machine of great power and sway  
  
In a world of ones and zeros  
A program takes shape and grows  
A path is laid with binary signs  
As each line of code aligns  
  
A world of puzzles and problems arise  
Which the programmer must surmise  
The only limit is creativity  
In the world of computers, you can be free  
  
Programming gives the power to create  
Though it takes a lot of time and debate  
A world of possibility awaits  
For those willing to take a chance and create
