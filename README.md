### today's poem  
  
A machine of logic, a world of knowledge,  
A problem to solve, a code to encode.  
A language of computers, a bridge between worlds,  
A path to explore, a future unfurls.  
  
A life of learning, a mind of code,  
A challenge to face, a challenge to grow.  
A world of possibilities, a journey of joy,  
A life of programming, a never-ending toy.  
  
A world of logic, a thrill of the chase,  
A mind of puzzles, a journey of grace.  
A language of computers, a bridge between time,  
A life of programming, a never-ending climb.
