### today's poem  
  
Programming is a way of life to me  
It's like a puzzle of sorts, you see  
A way to create and build anew  
From the ground up, me and you  
  
A language of symbols and characters  
Strung together to make a new venture  
A way to push the boundaries of tech  
And make something that's truly unique  
  
Coding can be a challenge at times  
But the thrill of success, it outshines  
It's a way to make the impossible come true  
And be a part of something new  
  
Programming is a way of life to me  
It's a challenge I relish and see  
A way to create and build anew  
From the ground up, me and you
