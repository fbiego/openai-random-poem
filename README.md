### today's poem  
  
Programming, the way to make a machine,  
A way to get things done with ease.  
  
You can create something quite sublime,  
With the help of a programming language.  
  
It's a way to control the flow of time,  
And bring your ideas to life.  
  
It's a way to create a new design,  
And turn a game into something sublime.  
  
Programming is a way to make a machine,  
And bring your dreams to reality.  
  
It's a way to create something grand,  
And put your mind to the test.  
  
Programming is a way to make a machine,  
A way to get things done with ease.
