### today's poem  
  
Programming is the passion of the few  
The ones who can see the code that others can't view  
Making something from nothing with just a few lines  
Solving problems and debugging until the solution shines  
  
It's a language that has its own set of rules  
Computers can understand it, but not all of us do  
Yet its application can help the world in diverse ways  
By creating the tools and solutions of today  
  
It's a task that requires focus and patience  
Where a little mistake can cause the program to not advance  
But with hard work and dedication, the results are great  
The feeling of accomplishment is truly worth the wait  
  
Programming is the future, and it's here to stay  
We should all embrace it and learn it every day  
So future generations will be able to do  
The same things we do, and more, in the years to come.
