### today's poem  
  
Programming is my life  
It keeps me up late at night  
I'm working on a bug  
To make my code just right  
  
My laptop's my companion  
As I type away each night  
I'm coding up a storm  
To make it all just right  
  
My fingers are my tools  
I'll write line after line  
Syntax and logic  
I'll make it all just right  
  
My brain is my best friend  
As I work through the night  
Fixing errors and testing  
To make it all just right  
  
My heart is full of joy  
As I see my work come alive  
My code is now complete  
It's perfect and just right
