### today's poem  
  
Programming, a skill so hard to learn  
At times it can make your head spin and turn  
  
The syntax and the language can be so obscure  
But when mastered, you will feel so pure  
  
The logic that goes into coding  
Can be a challenge that is overwhelming  
  
The patience and the time that it takes  
Can be a real mindbreaking ache  
  
But through the difficult moments  
You will find the joy that coding brings  
  
The feeling of accomplishment when you make it work  
Will make you feel so alert  
  
Programming is a skill of the future  
It will be something you will treasure
