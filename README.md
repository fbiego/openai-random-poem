### today's poem  
  
A computer is a tool,  
For programming its rule,  
A program is the key,  
For coding the techie.  
  
A program is a script,  
To follow a strict,  
Instructions so clear,  
To make them appear.  
  
To program a task,  
A language must be asked,  
Whether it's Python or Java,  
The code must be like lava.  
  
A program must be written,  
Data must be smitten,  
From the logic of a mind,  
Through a language it must find.  
  
A program is a story,  
Told in bits of glory,  
The message it must contain,  
To make sure it does remain.  
  
To program is to create,  
A masterpiece of fate,  
A program can be a thing,  
To make the world sing.
