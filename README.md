### today's poem  
  
Programming with its syntax and rules  
Making machines do what I choose  
Creating something from nothing  
My code can give life to the blues  
  
Into the world of codes I dive  
Exploring the realm of the byte  
Testing all the different parts  
To make sure that nothing is slight  
  
Finding solutions to problems  
These puzzles I enjoy to solve  
Writing algorithms and functions  
To make the most of the revolve  
  
Debugging with each line of code  
Editing what doesn't work  
Making sure all is running smoothly  
Is the challenge that I'm up to perk  
  
The beauty of programming  
A language I can control  
Making the impossible possible  
Is a satisfaction to behold
