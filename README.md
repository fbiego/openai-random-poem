### today's poem  
  
Programming is a magical thing,  
No matter how hard it may seem.  
It can teach us so much of life,  
Give us insight that we may need.  
  
We can learn about how to think,  
How to create and how to solve.  
Programming can teach us to be brave,  
It can give us the power to evolve.  
  
It can open up many doors,  
And let us explore the unknown.  
We can make something new and grand,  
It's a skill that we can own.  
  
Programming is a great tool,  
It can help us to succeed.  
It can give us the power to achieve,  
Anything we may need.
