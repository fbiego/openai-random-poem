### today's poem  
  
Programming's a complex art  
Built up on lines of code  
It takes a special kind of smart  
To create a working mode  
  
The language of computers is strange  
It's often quite obtuse  
But with practice and patience  
You can learn to use  
  
It's tedious, often hard  
But the rewards can be great  
The satisfaction of success  
Will be yours to take  
  
So sit down and start coding  
For hours at a time  
The rewards may not be seen  
But they'll be yours to find.
