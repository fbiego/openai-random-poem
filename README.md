### today's poem  
  
Programming is such a magical thing  
It can do so many amazing feats  
It can solve the most complex problems  
And make the most complex code look neat  
  
It's everywhere, from phones to TVs  
It's in the mundane and the sublime  
It's what makes our world go round  
And it's a most valuable life skill to climb  
  
From starting out with just a few basics  
To mastering complex algorithms  
The possibilities are endless  
From the code that you write, the stories that you tell  
  
Programming is like a puzzle to be solved  
It takes time and effort to make it all fit  
But with persistence and dedication  
You can create something you can truly commit  
  
Programming is a language of its own  
It's a way to make a mark and leave a legacy  
It's a way to express yourself  
And a way to make the world a better place to be.
