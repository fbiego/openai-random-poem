### today's poem  
  
My love for coding has no bounds,  
It's a language that makes no sounds.  
  
I learn its rules, but break them too,  
For complex problems, I have a clue.  
  
It's a challenge I don't take lightly,  
But I still find it oh so rightly.  
  
My brain itches when I'm stuck,  
But I don't give up, I just get up.  
  
I'm in a world of my own,  
Where the logic is my throne.  
  
In the midst of zeroes and ones,  
I make my program run.  
  
It's an art I truly love,  
Coding is something from above.
