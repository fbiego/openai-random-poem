### today's poem  
  
Coding is like a game,  
Creating something new each time.  
It's a challenge, a puzzle,  
A way to pass the time.  
  
Using logic and problem-solving,  
Building something complex,  
The satisfaction of the end result  
Is often worth the stress.  
  
It's the perfect way to express yourself,  
Your ideas and your dreams,  
And it's a craft that never ends,  
The possibilities seem endless.  
  
No matter what the language,  
Whether Java or C++,  
Programming is a skill that  
Will never cease to amaze me.
