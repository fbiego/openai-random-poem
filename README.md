### today's poem  
  
Coding is a journey, a constant discovery  
Where I can use my brain and explore  
  
To write a program, I must be precise  
My language must be clear and concise  
  
I must ask the right questions  
To find the best solutions  
  
I must debug and test  
To make sure the code does its best  
  
It can take days, sometimes weeks  
But in the end, the code speaks  
  
The code is my canvas, I bring it to life  
A creative work of art, a product of my mind  
  
Coding is my passion, it brings me delight  
I'm proud of the work I do day and night
