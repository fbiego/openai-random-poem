### today's poem  
  
Programming is a skill like no other,  
Creating a language of 0s and 1s  
From a world of pure imagination  
You can create a new innovation.  
  
You can create a website or an app  
It's like a never ending game of snap  
There's so much potential in code  
If you have the right mindset, you can go abroad.  
  
You can create a website or a game  
It's like putting together a puzzle, but not the same  
It's like a child's first steps, each line of code carefully placed  
And the end result will be a website with a beautiful face.  
  
You can create a program that can help  
It's like a doctor, providing a yelp  
It can help with calculations, or even more  
It can give information and so much more.  
  
Programming is a skill like no other  
It can make a difference in the world, like a brother  
From a world of pure imagination  
You can create a new innovation.
