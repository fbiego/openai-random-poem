### today's poem  
  
Programming's a language of its own,  
A way to make things be shown  
A way to make the world turn round,  
A way to make computers abound  
  
It's a set of instructions, so true,  
A way to make things come to life anew  
A way to make things work like a charm,  
A way to make things work without harm  
  
It's a world of logic and reason,  
A way to create a new season  
A way to make life easier and more fun,  
A way to make the most of what's done  
  
It's a way to learn and to grow,  
A way to make things go  
A way to make the world a better place,  
A way to make the future so we can face  
  
Programming's a language all its own,  
A way to make things be shown.
