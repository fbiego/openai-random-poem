### today's poem  
  
Programming is a skill that's highly sought,  
A language of commands that we ought  
To learn and master to help us stay ahead,  
With creativity, complexity is fed.  
  
It takes practice and patience of a kind,  
To be successful in this field of mind.  
For the code to be written,  
It takes effort, not just a smitten.  
  
But when the process is complete,  
The reward is so very sweet.  
For the effort and the time,  
The joy of coding is sublime.
