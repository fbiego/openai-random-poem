### today's poem  
  
Programming, a powerful tool  
Creating something out of nothing, no one can fool  
Inventing things, solutions for our needs  
With the potential to make the world a better place, indeed  
  
From websites to databases, programming can do it all  
Using languages like Python, JavaScript, and SQL  
Making games, and software, and complex algorithms  
Programming is the future, so it's time to learn it all  
  
A language of math and logic combined  
Programming is a great way to use your mind  
Learning it can be hard, but don't give up  
You'll reap the rewards if you drink from the cup  
  
Programming is a skill that's sought after  
It's the future, so you better not waiver  
So learn it, practice it, and make something great  
You won't regret it, it's guaranteed to be great.
