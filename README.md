### today's poem  
  
Programming's like a puzzle without end,  
A challenge that's often hard to comprehend.  
It's a language that's abstract and strange,  
But a powerful tool when it's in range.  
  
It's a skill that takes time and a lot of practice,  
It's not something you can learn in a single instance.  
It's a way of writing instructions that computers can read,  
To create something that's both complex and unique.  
  
Programmers search for the best solutions,  
Transforming ideas into tangible solutions.  
It's a profession that's really quite cool,  
And with dedication, you'll learn the rules.  
  
Programming's like an art form,  
A way of expressing yourself in the virtual norm.  
It's a skill that can be used in many ways,  
To make something that's really quite amazing.
