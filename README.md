### today's poem  
  
Programming, it's so hard to do  
It starts with a language you must learn anew  
You need to think logically and plan ahead  
Syntax errors could be your dread  
  
With the help of tutorials you'll soon see  
How to use the language to make your dreams  
Debugging will take a bit of time  
But soon you'll be coding in no time  
  
You'll be able to build games and apps galore  
And your own websites you can explore  
You'll be able to make a website more alive  
And add some dynamic features to strive  
  
Programming is like a puzzle to crack  
If you want to be successful, don't slack  
For if you keep your focus and stay on the task  
You'll soon be a programming master at last
