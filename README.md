### today's poem  
  
Softly, the code runs by  
Like a river meandering  
Through the night.  
  
A gentle, but powerful force  
It brings forth ideas, of course  
In the morning's light.  
  
The syntax, the data, the flow  
It all comes together, you know  
To make something grand.  
  
The structure and logic, the lines  
A program's complexity shines  
On the programmer's hand.  
  
And so, we write and we code  
Asking ourselves, what is the load  
That our programs must bear?  
  
We build it up and we test  
To make our programs the best  
And make them run without fear.  
  
So, for all of the coders out there  
Let's join our voices in the air  
And sing of our programming!
