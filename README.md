### today's poem  
  
Coding my way through the night,  
My mind is a hive of delight.  
The code is a language all its own,  
Complex, yet at the same time, known.  
  
My fingers type away in a trance,  
Every line of code I advance.  
The challenge of the task at hand,  
Is something I just understand.  
  
My monitor is my friend and guide,  
Where I can work side by side.  
The lines of code keep piling up,  
As I'm working on my cup.  
  
My skill I will never forget,  
My programming skills are a debt.  
For the things that I have done,  
I'm sure I will have lots of fun.
