### today's poem  
  
Programming is my art, so deep and so complex  
A craft of algorithms and code that perplex  
A language so esoteric and so refined  
It's an art that can be so hard to define  
  
It takes a special kind of skill to understand  
The logic and the processes that are at hand  
A world of ones and zeros, a virtual reality  
A world that's ever changing, a language of agility  
  
It's a challenge to the mind, a puzzle to solve  
A way to manipulate the data that involves  
A chance to put together the pieces of the code  
To make a program that will run and not explode!  
  
Programming is a journey, a chance to explore  
A way to create something, a task to adore  
The satisfaction of seeing something complete  
A feeling that can't be beat, a chance to compete  
  
Programming is a language that is so profound  
A way to create something new and profound  
A skill that requires a dedication and a drive  
To understand and learn, and to help others thrive
