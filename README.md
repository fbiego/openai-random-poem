### today's poem  
  
Programming is a wonderful thing,  
No matter if it's coding or a string.  
It's a language that's used to turn ideas into reality,  
And can make you feel like a modern day alchemist.  
  
We can make something from nothing with the power of our code,  
From webpages to games, it's a language that's constantly evolving.  
From simple lines of code to complex algorithms,  
Programming can make the impossible, possible.  
  
It's a language of clarity, a language of precision,  
A language of problem solving, a language of decision.  
It can bring structure to our thoughts and can help us to create,  
From the most basic of programs to those most intricate.  
  
Programming is a powerful tool,  
One that can make our dreams come true.  
It can teach us new ways of thinking,  
And give us control of the world we're living in.
