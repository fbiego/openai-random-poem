### today's poem  
  
The art of programming  
Is like a song so sweet,  
The logic and the coding  
Can bring a project to its feet.  
  
The syntax and the structures  
Can be tricky at first,  
But with practice and patience  
You'll pass any test.  
  
You'll learn to debug and troubleshoot,  
You'll refactor code with care,  
And you'll create a masterpiece  
That you can proudly share.  
  
You'll write programs that are efficient  
And solve problems with ease,  
You'll find joy and satisfaction  
In your coding prowess.  
  
The art of programming  
Is a craft to behold,  
So keep coding and learning  
As your skills unfold.
