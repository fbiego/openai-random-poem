### today's poem  
  
Programming seems like a chore,  
Full of puzzles, loops and more,  
But it can also be quite fun,  
Writing code till day is done.  
  
High and low, left and right,  
Indentation must be just right,  
Computer screens fill my night,  
Coding's a skill I must fight.  
  
Syntax errors, debugging too,  
It can make me feel blue,  
But it's also quite a thrill,  
To get code to work against its will.  
  
Programming is a skill,  
That's both hard and still,  
But it's worth every bit,  
To make something that works and fits.
