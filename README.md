### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a secret language  
It's cryptic and it's strange  
It can take a while to master  
But it's worth the change  
  
It's a way of thinking  
Where problem solving reigns  
It's a way of life  
Where the logical brain trains  
  
You can build a game  
Or an app, website or program  
It's a creative process  
Where the sky's the limit  
  
And when the code is all done  
You'll be so proud  
Because you created something  
That will be talked about  
  
So don't give up  
And don't give in  
Programming can be hard  
But it's worth the win
