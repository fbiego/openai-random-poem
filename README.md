### today's poem  
  
Programming, the language of the future  
A complex code that is a real suture  
A digital language that is oh so pure  
Bringing our ideas to life, no more obscure  
  
A way to create, to imagine, to explore  
To find the hidden paths, the unknown door  
A way to be creative and think to the core  
A way to build something, and never be bored  
  
Programming is a way to make life more fun  
To create something great, for everyone  
A way to learn and explore new ideas  
Programming is the language of the future, no more seize  
  
A way to build a world no one has seen  
A way to make something that will leave a dream  
Programming is the language that will never be done  
It will continue to grow, never be none
