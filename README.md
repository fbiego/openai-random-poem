### today's poem  
  
Programming is a language all its own,  
A way to create a world of our own.  
A way to make machines come alive,  
To make the world so much more alive.  
  
A way to create a work of art,  
To make a game that's hard to outsmart.  
A way to build a website too,  
A way for us to see the view.  
  
Programming is a skill to learn,  
A way to succeed and not to spurn.  
A way to open up your mind,  
A way to make things kind of shine.  
  
Programming is a complex thing,  
And it's not for those who can't cling.  
But it's an art form all its own,  
A way to make a world of our own.
