### today's poem  
  
Programming is like a river,  
It has many turns and twists,  
It can be hard to navigate,  
But it's worth the risk.  
  
It's a way to create,  
To explore new ideas,  
To build something great,  
And make it come alive.  
  
It's a puzzle, a game,  
A challenge that's hard to tame,  
But if you stay on the path,  
You will learn, and you will last.  
  
Programming is a journey,  
A journey of discovery,  
And if you're willing to learn,  
You'll find a world of adventure,  
Be sure to take the time,  
To learn the things you'll find.  
  
Programming is a passion,  
It's a way to express,  
To shape and create,  
Your own unique success.
